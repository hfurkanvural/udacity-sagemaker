/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

<hr>
<p>Now that we have a basic understanding of how SageMaker works we will try to use it to construct a complete project from end to end. Our goal will be to have a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to our deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.</p>
<h2 id="Instructions">Instructions<a class="anchor-link" href="#Instructions">&#182;</a></h2><p>Some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this notebook. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with '<strong>TODO</strong>' in the header indicate that you need to complete or implement some portion within them. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a <code># TODO: ...</code> comment. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!</p>
<p>In addition to implementing code, there will be questions for you to answer which relate to the task and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a '<strong>Question:</strong>' header. Carefully read each question and provide your answer below the '<strong>Answer:</strong>' header by editing the Markdown cell.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the <strong>Shift+Enter</strong> keyboard shortcut. In addition, a cell can be edited by typically clicking it (double-click for Markdown cells) or by pressing <strong>Enter</strong> while it is highlighted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="General-Outline">General Outline<a class="anchor-link" href="#General-Outline">&#182;</a></h2><p>Recall the general outline for SageMaker projects using a notebook instance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download or otherwise retrieve the data.</li>
<li>Process / Prepare the data.</li>
<li>Upload the processed data to S3.</li>
<li>Train a chosen model.</li>
<li>Test the trained model (typically using a batch transform job).</li>
<li>Deploy the trained model.</li>
<li>Use the deployed model.</li>
</ol>
<p>For this project, you will be following the steps in the general outline with some modifications.</p>
<p>First, you will not be testing the model in its own step. You will still be testing the model, however, you will do it by deploying your model and then using the deployed model by sending the test data to it. One of the reasons for doing this is so that you can make sure that your deployed model is working correctly before moving forward.</p>
<p>In addition, you will deploy and use your trained model a second time. In the second iteration you will customize the way that your trained model is deployed by including some of your own code. In addition, your newly deployed model will be used in the sentiment analysis web app.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Above we mentioned that <code>review_to_words</code> method removes html formatting and allows us to tokenize the words found in a review, for example, converting <em>entertained</em> and <em>entertaining</em> into <em>entertain</em> so that they are treated as though they are the same word. What else, if anything, does this method do to the input?</p>

<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
Method removes not only html formatting in the input but also makes all the characters lowercase. And also, it stems and removes non-alphanumerical and stopwords. Finally splits words.</p>

<p>The method below applies the <code>review_to_words</code> method to each of the reviews in the training and testing datasets. In addition it caches the results. This is because performing this processing step can take a long time. This way if you are unable to complete the notebook in the current session, you can come back without needing to process the data a second time.</p>

<h2 id="Transform-the-data">Transform the data<a class="anchor-link" href="#Transform-the-data">&#182;</a></h2><p>In the XGBoost notebook we transformed the data from its word representation to a bag-of-words feature representation. For the model we are going to construct in this notebook we will construct a feature representation which is very similar. To start, we will represent each word as an integer. Of course, some of the words that appear in the reviews occur very infrequently and so likely don't contain much information for the purposes of sentiment analysis. The way we will deal with this problem is that we will fix the size of our working vocabulary and we will only include the words that appear most frequently. We will then combine all of the infrequent words into a single category and, in our case, we will label it as <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>Since we will be using a recurrent neural network, it will be convenient if the length of each review is the same. To do this, we will fix a size for our reviews and then pad short reviews with the category 'no word' (which we will label <code>0</code>) and truncate long reviews.</p>

<h3 id="(TODO)-Create-a-word-dictionary">(TODO) Create a word dictionary<a class="anchor-link" href="#(TODO)-Create-a-word-dictionary">&#182;</a></h3><p>To begin with, we need to construct a way to map words that appear in the reviews to integers. Here we fix the size of our vocabulary (including the 'no word' and 'infrequent' categories) to be <code>5000</code> but you may wish to change this to see how it affects the model.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>TODO:</strong> Complete the implementation for the <code>build_dict()</code> method below. Note that even though the vocab_size is set to <code>5000</code>, we only want to construct a mapping for the most frequently appearing <code>4998</code> words. This is because we want to reserve the special labels <code>0</code> for 'no word' and <code>1</code> for 'infrequent word'.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> In the cells above we use the <code>preprocess_data</code> and <code>convert_and_pad_data</code> methods to process both the training and testing set. Why or why not might this be a problem?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> 
I don't think it will be a big issue but using same vocab dictionary in test and training dataset is a bit tricky. Since, test dataset can have some good or bad words, they can be missed in training data and it can affect the performance of the model. Also convert_and_pad_data ignores the words in long reviews and this can cause information loss.</p>

<p>The important takeaway from the implementation provided is that there are three parameters that we may wish to tweak to improve the performance of our model. These are the embedding dimension, the hidden dimension and the size of the vocabulary. We will likely want to make these parameters configurable in the training script so that if we wish to modify them we do not need to modify the script itself. We will see how to do this later on. To start we will write some of the training code in the notebook so that we can more easily diagnose any issues that arise.</p>
<p>First we will load a small portion of the training data set to use as a sample. It would be very time consuming to try and train the model completely in the notebook as we do not have access to a gpu and the compute instance that we are using is not particularly powerful. However, we can work on a small bit of the data to get a feel for how our training script is behaving.</p>

We may optionally include a directory which will be copied to the container and from which our training code will be run.

<h3 id="(TODO)-Training-the-model">(TODO) Training the model<a class="anchor-link" href="#(TODO)-Training-the-model">&#182;</a></h3><p>When a PyTorch model is constructed in SageMaker, an entry point must be specified. This is the Python file which will be executed when the model is trained. Inside of the <code>train</code> directory is a file called <code>train.py</code> which has been provided and which contains most of the necessary code to train our model. The only thing that is missing is the implementation of the <code>train()</code> method which you wrote earlier in this notebook.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: Copy the <code>train()</code> method written above and paste it into the <code>train/train.py</code> file where required.</p>
<p>The way that SageMaker passes hyperparameters to the training script is by way of arguments. These arguments can then be parsed and used in the training script. To see how this is done take a look at the provided <code>train/train.py</code> file.</p>

<h2 id="Step-5:-Testing-the-model">Step 5: Testing the model<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-5:-Testing-the-model">&#182;</a></h2><p>As mentioned at the top of this notebook, we will be testing this model by first deploying it and then sending the testing data to the deployed endpoint. We will do this so that we can make sure that the deployed model is working correctly.</p>
<h2 id="Step-6:-Deploy-the-model-for-testing">Step 6: Deploy the model for testing<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-6:-Deploy-the-model-for-testing">&#182;</a></h2><p>Now that we have trained our model, we would like to test it to see how it performs. Currently our model takes input of the form <code>review_length, review[500]</code> where <code>review[500]</code> is a sequence of <code>500</code> integers which describe the words present in the review, encoded using <code>word_dict</code>. Fortunately for us, SageMaker provides built-in inference code for models with simple inputs such as this.</p>
<p>There is one thing that we need to provide, however, and that is a function which loads the saved model. This function must be called <code>model_fn()</code> and takes as its only parameter a path to the directory where the model artifacts are stored. This function must also be present in the python file which we specified as the entry point. In our case the model loading function has been provided and so no changes need to be made.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: When the built-in inference code is run it must import the <code>model_fn()</code> method from the <code>train.py</code> file. This is why the training code is wrapped in a main guard ( ie, <code>if __name__ == '__main__':</code> )</p>
<p>Since we don't need to change anything in the code that was uploaded during training, we can simply deploy the current model as-is.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When deploying a model you are asking SageMaker to launch an compute instance that will wait for data to be sent to it. As a result, this compute instance will continue to run until <em>you</em> shut it down. This is important to know since the cost of a deployed endpoint depends on how long it has been running for.</p>
<p>In other words <strong>If you are no longer using a deployed endpoint, shut it down!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
As far as I can see, XGBoost have performed a little bit better. Yet, I have only 5 epoch in this project and did not do hyperparamter tuning that affects the results.</p>
<p>I think RNN (specially for this kind of long-term web project) can be perform better in long term. Since, it has very efficient memory system it can adapt the language of the time and can still perform well with past phrases.</p>
<p>Also, XGBoost mostly performs in small dataset when we compare it to RNN. But RNN can handle huge datasets better in performance and can give better output results.</p>

However, ultimately we would like to be able to send our model an unprocessed review. That is, we would like to send the review itself as a string. For example, suppose we wish to send the following review to our model.</p>

<p>The question we now need to answer is, how do we send this review to our model?</p>
<p>Recall in the first section of this notebook we did a bunch of data processing to the IMDb dataset. In particular, we did two specific things to the provided reviews.</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed any html tags and stemmed the input</li>
<li>Encoded the review as a sequence of integers using <code>word_dict</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In order process the review we will need to repeat these two steps.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: Using the <code>review_to_words</code> and <code>convert_and_pad</code> methods from section one, convert <code>test_review</code> into a numpy array <code>test_data</code> suitable to send to our model. Remember that our model expects input of the form <code>review_length, review[500]</code>.</p>

<p>As we saw above, by default the estimator which we created, when deployed, will use the entry script and directory which we provided when creating the model. However, since we now wish to accept a string as input and our model expects a processed review, we need to write some custom inference code.</p>
<p>We will store the code that we write in the <code>serve</code> directory. Provided in this directory is the <code>model.py</code> file that we used to construct our model, a <code>utils.py</code> file which contains the <code>review_to_words</code> and <code>convert_and_pad</code> pre-processing functions which we used during the initial data processing, and <code>predict.py</code>, the file which will contain our custom inference code. Note also that <code>requirements.txt</code> is present which will tell SageMaker what Python libraries are required by our custom inference code.</p>
<p>When deploying a PyTorch model in SageMaker, you are expected to provide four functions which the SageMaker inference container will use.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>model_fn</code>: This function is the same function that we used in the training script and it tells SageMaker how to load our model.</li>
<li><code>input_fn</code>: This function receives the raw serialized input that has been sent to the model's endpoint and its job is to de-serialize and make the input available for the inference code.</li>
<li><code>output_fn</code>: This function takes the output of the inference code and its job is to serialize this output and return it to the caller of the model's endpoint.</li>
<li><code>predict_fn</code>: The heart of the inference script, this is where the actual prediction is done and is the function which you will need to complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the simple website that we are constructing during this project, the <code>input_fn</code> and <code>output_fn</code> methods are relatively straightforward. We only require being able to accept a string as input and we expect to return a single value as output. You might imagine though that in a more complex application the input or output may be image data or some other binary data which would require some effort to serialize.</p>
<h3 id="(TODO)-Writing-inference-code">(TODO) Writing inference code<a class="anchor-link" href="#(TODO)-Writing-inference-code">&#182;</a></h3><p>Before writing our custom inference code, we will begin by taking a look at the code which has been provided.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The default behaviour for a deployed PyTorch model is to assume that any input passed to the predictor is a <code>numpy</code> array. In our case we want to send a string so we need to construct a simple wrapper around the <code>RealTimePredictor</code> class to accomodate simple strings.

The reason for only sending some of the data is that the amount of time it takes for our model to process the input and then perform inference is quite long and so testing the entire data set would be prohibitive.</p>

b&#39;Luchino Visconti has become famous to the world after his marvelous production THE LEOPARD. Movie fans got to know the style of the director who introduced himself as one among the post war new realists, an aristocrat who developed his individual free thinking and, consequently, expressed them as an artist. However, when applied to this movie, MORTE A VENEZIA based upon the novel by Thomas Mann, it\&#39;s a slightly different story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire film is, at first view, so unique, so psychological and so much influenced by the various thoughts of an artist (both director and main character Gustav von Aschenbach) that it seems to be &#34;unwatchable&#34; for many viewers. Therefore, such opinions about the movie rose as being &#34;too slow&#34;, &#34;unendurable&#34; or &#34;endless boredom&#34;. Why? The reason seems to lie in a significant view widespread nowadays: &#34;GOOD MOVIE IS PARALLEL TO FLAWLESS ACTION.&#34; Here, it would be appropriate to say: &#34;GOOD MOVIE IS PARALLEL TO NO ACTION.&#34; As a matter of fact, everyone would be able to say one sentence about the whole movie\&#39;s content and that would suffice. All that we find in MORTE A VENEZIA has a sense of vague reality filled with both profoundity and shallowness that appear to be significant for the sake of each single moment. And it is so when we notice the psychedelic scenes in Venice, when we see Gustav at the railroad station, when we are supplied with his intensely emotional memories. The insight into his decaying mind is sometimes so intense that the only way for the viewer to go on watching the film is to do his/her best to feel and experience rather than see and think. All is doomed to fade, to wither like flowers on meadow when their time comes. In other words, all has a sense of loss and death without many events or even dialogs. As a result, it is quite unlikely that you will get the idea of the movie after a single viewing. It must be seen more than twice with the mind that is constantly open. If you\&#39;ll like it or not...that\&#39;s a different story, very personal one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The artistic values are the factor that is noticeable at first sight and stays with us throughout. Beauty as something very meaningful for the main character that appears to come and leave; rest as something he\&#39;s heading for so badly and which comes to him in the most unexpected way; feeling that he finds in a teenage boy who appears as a model of all the dreams and desires, as a forbidden fruit of homosexual lust which vanishes. The costume designer Piero Tosi does a splendid job in this movie. Through lots of wonderful wardrobe he supplies us with a very realistic view of 1911 when the action takes place. The cinematographer Pasqualino De Santis provides us with a terrific visual experience that can be called a real feast for the eyes. And in the background comes Gustav Mahler\&#39;s music, the composer whose life inspired Thomas Mann to introduce the character. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performances are top notch, particularly from Dirk Bogart as the main character, Gustav von Aschenbach, who wants a rest after hard artistic job and vainly attempts to find it in crowded Venice. For the majority of the film, we have a great insight into his thoughts, feelings and acts of anger, exhaust and despair. Though sometimes depressing, he keeps us on the right track till the end not losing hope for the less tragic end... Tadzio (Bjorn Andersen) depicts the model of decadent homosexual desire but also a model of beauty and purity that appears to last pretty short... &#34;Adieu Tadzio, it was all too short&#34; says the main character. A great, though very controversial, job is done by Mark Burns as a sort of &#34;super ego&#34; Alfred with whom Gustav polemics about such ideals as beauty, justice, hope, human dignity. For Alfred, beauty belongs to the senses. How Freudian, yet how dangerous the idea might be! And ever present in artistic Italian movies of the time, Silvana Mangano - here as an elegant lady from Poland, Tadzio\&#39;s mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Memorable moments indeed constitute the movie\&#39;s strong points; yet, not all viewers will find them unforgettable. They, similarly to the whole odd movie, require much effort to get onto the right track in director\&#39;s individual ego and within the four walls of his psyche. Among such scenes, I consider the beach sequence pretty important, particularly the way Gustav observes Tadzio. The physical distance accurately represents the lack of courage to come closer... I also appreciate the shots when Gustav is sitting in the gondola and the city\&#39;s view moves in the background - how memorably that may raise existential thoughts of transfer. Aren\&#39;t we, people, a sort of &#34;passangers&#34; in the world, in the journey that life is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I must tell you one important thing. I had found MORTE A VENEZIA extremely weird until I started to look deeper at what the director is really trying to convey. Then, every scene turned out to be meaningful in its interpretation with which you don\&#39;t have to agree (I hardly agree with anything the main character does) but you should at least tolerate this as something the author badly wanted to say. Listen to his voice, allow him for a few words in one page of reality...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, there is a long way towards understanding the film since not many movies like that were being made in 1971 and are being made now. Paradoxically, it seems that we are all bound to have the right feelings about this film in the long run similarly to that we are all bound to experience once a strange, unavoidable, usually unexpected reality that death is... 7/10&#39;
b&#39;I chose &#34;The English Patient&#34; for a history extra credit assignment. I thought that this movie would be incredibly boring. Instead, it has become one of my favorites. It portrays life in WWII quite accurately, and the love story is amazing. The love story made the movie so incredible. I felt this interesting feeling, of passion or something. It made me want to watch the movie over and over again. Kristin Scott Thomas and Ralph Fiennes are amazing actors and the way they played their characters is amazing. The look wonderful together and actually seemed to be in love. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a movie to watch as a leisure activity, or for an assignment.&#39;
b&#39;My yardstick for measuring a movie\&#39;s watch-ability is if I get squirmy. If I start shifting positions and noticing my butt is sore, the film is too long. This movie did not even come close to being boring. Predictable in some parts sure, but never boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the other military branches have had love notes written about them and seen their recruitment levels go up, why not the Coast Guard too? They are definitely under-appreciated, until the day your boat sinks that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie was very enjoyable and fun. Kevin Costner is perfect as the aging macho man who doesn\&#39;t know when to quit. However, I was most impressed by Ashton Kutcher\&#39;s performance. I have never liked him, never watched any of his TV shows and always considered him an immature ... well, punk. In this film, he does a great job! He is well on his way to having leading-man status. I think the film we were shown must have been an advance rough cut or something, because about 2/3 of the way in, the film stock turned very grainy, the sound level dropped and microphones were seen dropping down all over the place. Also at the viewing were representatives from the movie, looking for audience feedback - particularly on the parts of the film we didn\&#39;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****POSSIBLE SPOILER: The feedback I gave concerned a a couple of lines in the beginning. Kevin Costner comes home to see his wife, Sela Ward, packing her stuff up and moving out. He says, &#34;Maybe I should be the one to move out.&#34; And she replies, &#34;No, you don\&#39;t know where anything is in this house; I should be the one to go.&#34; This doesn\&#39;t make sense: If she knows the layout so well, Costner is right, he *should* be the one to leave.&#39;
b&#39;What can I say? Not as bad as many here have made it out to be. The only reason I even watched this film that I had previously never heard of before, was strictly for IAN McSHANE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed in the least. IAN McSHANE was absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to his role. He\&#39;s always great to watch and for my money... an extremely underused actor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the rest of the film.... Every other actor in the movie delivered strong, solid performances. These people certainly weren\&#39;t being paid huge amounts of cash for their participation (as this was a fairly low budget film) but this did not mean that any of them &#34;mailed&#34; their appearances in. Everyone was convincing and compelling with the parts given to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was even pleasantly surprised at ADRIAN PAUL\&#39;s performance though I must admit I have only ever seen him in the HIGHLANDER Television series before this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot was well paced and the storyline intriguing and much like real life, not everything ends up tied in a nice neat little package for you at the end of the film. Anybody who expected a clear-cut, by-the-numbers, connect the dots &#34;conclusion&#34; or &#34;answer&#34; at the end of the movie... CLEARLY wasn\&#39;t watching the film closely enough! This film is not going to tell you what the &#34;meaning of life&#34; is! The idea is that after seeing the film, you might go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends over a coffee. I certainly did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No car chases... No explosions... No bar room brawls.... (sounds pretty dull, huh?) But the reality is that I was completely absorbed by the film and it\&#39;s just a well written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performances by all parties involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****** WARNING...****** If you\&#39;re the kind of person who dislikes movies that dangle an enormous &#34;question&#34; as the central engine of the story and then end the movie without answering that particular question directly...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU MIGHT NOT ENJOY THIS FILM.&#39;
b&#34;The film was apparently spawned from an idea one of the writers had when he &#39;saw&#39; one of his creations in a supermarket. The inhabitants of Royston Vasey head into &#39;our&#39; world to persuade the writers not to stop writing about them and thus destroy their world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that sounds a bit too serious, don&#39;t be put off. Within the first few minutes we get: Bernice (the vile female vicar) letting rip at an unfortunate penitent during confession; Chinnery (the vet who inadvertently destroys every animal he touches) attempting to collect semen from a giraffe; Mickey (thick beyond belief) being, ah, thick; and Tubbs (inbred sister-wife and local shopkeeper) being sweet as ever - but still disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the regular characters are missing, but a new idea by the Gents introduces some 16th-Century characters - and we have the Gents themselves in the action too. If you&#39;re new to The League of Gentlemen, this is an easy introduction and a lot of fun. If you&#39;re a long-standing fan, this has everything you&#39;ve come to expect - including the joys of Jeremy Dyson spotting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, it&#39;s got the same faintly surreal humour that&#39;s the hallmark of the series, plus some moments of quite touching &#39;introspection&#39;. Herr Lipp, for example, maintains a gentle dignity on learning that he&#39;s regarded by his creators as a &#39;one-joke character&#39;. While most of the characters stay as they are, some develop in unexpected ways that are perfectly natural when they happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is a &#39;swan song&#39; for Royston Vasey, but it&#39;s also a showcase for the Gents who prove that (gasp!) they can write other stuff - and it can be very funny. (But you knew that anyway.)&#34;
b&#39;Back in August, \&#39;81 there was a country-ish buzz to movies, big hits like &#34;Urban Cowboy&#34;, &#34;Every Which Way But Loose&#34;, &#34;Smokey and the Bandit&#34; were all the rage. For that reason I suspect the producers of this movie chose &#34;Honky Tonk Freeway&#34; as the title hoping it would help the movie\&#39;s box office receipts by drawing in that same &#34;Urban Cowboy&#34; crowd. Instead &#34;Honky Tonk Freeway&#34; bombed at the theaters and I suspect it do so in part by being burdened with a poorly chosen title. Thats same problem burdens it now on video and thats too bad because its a pretty good movie and in a comedy style ahead of it\&#39;s time. No matter what, probably anybody who can remember 1981 will enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its too bad this movie bombed. But I think it would have anyway even if it hadn\&#39;t been saddled with a poor title. Its a movie ahead of its time. One could look at this movie now and see that its clearly a father or *great-uncle anyway) to the kinds of comedy made today. For its day &#34;Honky Tonk Freeway&#34; was pretty full of innuendo and a kind of frankness about life that didn\&#39;t get popular in comedy till much later on. While clearly its a child of &#34;Airplane&#34;, its more mature, and while its certainly no &#34;Knocked Up&#34; it clearly points in that direction. The characters are more &#34;comedy-mature&#34; in that they are low-key and don\&#39;t ever think anything they do is anything other than serious. The jokes are in the choices of what to emphasize and the camera views and the way the view themselves and their situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, more than that, &#34;Honky Tonk Freeway&#34; is a real time capsule. A great look back at the exceedingly early 80\&#39;s. The people in this movie are dressed and act as everyday people of 1981 did. It was clearly meant to reflect the times and be a sly comedic comment on everyday life around them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t know if my review is helping you, but this is really a good, sometimes kind of excellent, movie thats worth renting if you want to see how a lot of faces that are familiar today looked when they were 30 years younger. Beverly D\&#39;Angelo is so young its hard to realize its her sometimes. So are Beau Bridges and Terri Garr. Terry Garr was just about to become the toast of Hollywood as her next movie after this one was &#34;Tootsie&#34; which finally made her a star. Howard Hessmann was arguably the biggest &#34;current&#34; star of the the day when this movie was made. Back in 1981 Howard Hessmann was the star of the big hit TV show &#34;WKRP in Cinncinatti&#34;. He played its lead character, the rascally night DJ. Daniel Stern was just about to break out as a star as the grown-up narrator voice of the lead child character in the popular 80\&#39;s sitcom &#34;The Wonder Years&#34; There are also several faces that are no longer with us these days, its nice to see Hume Crowyn and Jessica Tandy as a an old married couple on a journey. Jessica Tandy would finally pick up her Oscar ten years after this for &#34;Driving Miss Daisy&#34;. There is also the great Geraldine Page in one of her final movie appearances. Though she\&#39;d had a brilliant career she didn\&#39;t get her Oscar till four years after this in 1985\&#39;s &#34;Trip to Bountiful&#34;, for which she richly deserved it, and she died very soon after getting that award.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, there are lots of other faces in this movie, actors who aren\&#39;t big stars but who have done tons of supporting work. Many are familiar even if you can\&#39;t think of their name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is a pleasant little diversion. A bunch of people with a variety of problems set out from various locations each for their own individual unrelated reasons who all, in a vaguely Altman-esk way, end up heading towards Florida and unbeknownst to them a rendevoux in the little town of Ticlaw, Florida, which happens to be reeling from the effects of being bypassed by the recently constructed interstate nearby which did not construct an exit to Ticlaw which effectively takes the town off the map.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And thats also what this movie is about, fascination with the whole idea of the interstate system, which had only recently been &#34;completed&#34;. It had taken a generation to build, from when it was authorized by congress around 1960, through many years as different parts were built and then &#34;went live&#34; and by 1980 most of the system had finally been built and all connected together and first the first time the promise of what the interstate system would be had turned into what is. And people were enchanted by it. Everybody by 1980 was pretty much an &#34;interstate freeway veteran&#34; in the sense that by then everybody had used parts of it and knew how it worked and how it was different from other roads in that it had no red lights or stop signs, only on and off ramps, and that it went to places that were formerly less accessible. By 1980 anyone could drive anywhere in comfort and without having to stop for anything except to eat and sleep and a bathroom. And this was all new then. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending is anti-climatic and isn\&#39;t that satisfying albeit its one spectacular moment. What makes it great is it\&#39;s the journey not the destination that makes Honky Tonk Freeway timeless in spite of it being such a product of its day. Forget its title; instead let it take you down memory lane.&#39;
b&#34;Another period piece for Chen Kiage... (can&#39;t remember him doing a modern film!)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good characterization with a simple story of trust and broken promises. None of the HK fighting scenes, or the Hollywood type of heroes, but it is good because of it. The characters are strong, I really felt for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Understanding the mandarin definitely gives the English subtitles the edge. The film is 3 hours, but it didn&#39;t feel like it.&#34;
b&#39;I think it\&#39;s the sort of film you either love or hate and I\&#39;m really not the type to go in for arty movies. My mother rented &#34;mullhuland DR&#34; the other night and I nearly ran from the room, ha. But I love this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We recorded &#34;The Beat&#34; one night when we had just let the tape run and got a great film that way by accident. Saved that tape and watched it a lot. I eventually got the VHS to add to my collection. I\&#39;ve watched it many times and at one point copied down the poems. I even tried to preform one scene for my high school drama class. She had said we could do any scene we wanted and just cut out the bad words. She refused to let me do it. If it could upset my drama teacher that much it has to be good :) Honest she never treated me the same after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the acting it came off very true and honest. It wasn\&#39;t clean and polished but it was better than that. It was true to life, how anyone would truly behave and display emotions not how Hollywood does. It was great acting especially by the one playing Rex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story was original. Not only do the characters get drawn into his world but you do too. Not your typical person meets inner city kids and saves them through knowledge film at all. Simply caring and friendship make things a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that even in the 80\&#39;s there was more gun violence and less simple stuff like rock throwing but that little bit of innocence didn\&#39;t hurt this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it\&#39;s a must see. you will either love or hate it but either way it makes an impact and that makes a good film that you will remember and talk about later.&#39;
b&#34;The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that not many people have seen. Clearly not that many because it only got a 6.8. There is nothing wrong with it at all. It&#39;s my favorite of the Disney classics, which have tons of fantastic films already made. Like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, and Peter Pan. The reason why The Aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how funny the film is. I hate to say this, but I don&#39;t blame Edgar for what he does. I probably would&#39;ve had them taken care of too. I&#39;d be devastated of some old bag who I&#39;d been working with for so many years just decides to give her will to the cats. I&#39;d of killed them also. I don&#39;t even like cats, so I wouldn&#39;t give a damn. I think that The Aristorcats is so funny and cute. There are many characters that are hilarious, like Edgar. The Aristorcats is my favorite of the Disney classics, and that&#39;s final. The Cat&#39;s out of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aristorcats: ****/****&#34;
b&#39;As if reality shows like &#34;American Idol&#34; weren\&#39;t enough, in which judges like Simon Cowell shoot razor-sharp barbs to contestants trying to make their mark on the music world -- barbs that many a time has reduced even outstanding singers to tears after what was deemed a &#34;bad performance&#34;, now &#34;America\&#39;s Next Top Model&#34; has for the past three years invaded the boob tube with its own version of &#34;looking for the next big thing&#34; in a business that values superficiality, concepts of beauty, and body dysmorphia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A concept created by Tyra Banks, who is also a judge in the show, it gathers some fifteen contestants from all walks of life and has them submit themselves to innumerable &#34;tasks&#34; in which they must prove their &#34;talent&#34; in front of the camera and subject themselves not only to the now departed Janice Dickinson (self-dubbed &#34;American\&#39;s First Supermodel&#34;) but the equally catty Jay Manuel and Nore Marin who may at one point focus on one girl not performing well and blithely rip her to shreds like it was bad morning coffee. Like in many other reality-based shows, each week one contestant is voted off and must pack her bags and immediately leave (a thing that they are reminded by Tyra at every turn). Of course, there is the bitchy tension between several of the more type-A females, female bonding, tears, dramatic swells of music in key moments, and some truly breathtaking pictures that transform erstwhile ordinary, pretty girls into unattainable goddesses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;ll have to admit, the show is a guilty pleasure. Maybe it\&#39;s the state of mind I\&#39;m in, but I kept wondering where the vomitorium was in cases when the already thin girls would need to hurl to make the cut and look the way the judges and photographers and many fickle designers would feel was correct for the moment. Even so, it\&#39;s drawn me in despite my previous paragraph, possibly because I\&#39;ve always had an interest in the fashion world and have always loved watching stunning women being made even more unworldly with make up and perfect lighting. But I wonder where are they going with these increasingly difficult photo shoots. It\&#39;s as if they were competing with &#34;Fear Factor&#34;. Shoots that look like re-enactments of fight scenes in CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, shoots where the models have to pose underwater or in almost impossible situations, What\&#39;s next: posing while tied to train tracks as an oncoming Amtrak roars upon them at 70 miles an hour? Or a shoot where they are underwater, chained, trying to set themselves free in record time while at the same time looking smashing in chiffon, and never, ever forgetting to smile their pearly whites at that camera? How about a &#34;Pit and the Pendulum&#34; version of a photo shoot?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one thing the show has to be given some kudos, and it\&#39;s in a way akin to &#34;American Idol&#34;. With this I\&#39;m probably going to justify the harshness of both shows, and its abrasive judges -- and essentially go against my initial paragraph. &#34;America\&#39;s Next Top Model&#34; is a show that is an extended audition, like &#34;American Idol&#34;, and in it the girls will get the sort of test treatment they will receive in the real world, where prospective designers and photographers, as monstrously fickle as they can be, will crush them to bits at the drop of a hat if they can\&#39;t sell themselves the way they\&#39;re expected to, and where one is asked to leave, another will supplant her with the necessary requirements. Which makes it a wonder that any girl would want to get into such a difficult media, but that\&#39;s what dreams are made of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going into its Fifth season it\&#39;s been a major disappointment with the departure of Janice Dickinson; during her run she was a pretty tough barometer as to how the girls should walk, talk, emote, express themselves, and ultimately present themselves as a walking, living product that sells. With the cold addition of Twiggy I wonder where it will go from here -- Twiggy just can\&#39;t replace the over-the-top temperament of Dickinson. So with Janice\&#39;s absence the show has lost some of its edge and may even have signaled its slow demise, but in the meantime, it\&#39;s still a catchy pleasure to watch, mindless entertainment on weeknights, if at all for the gorgeous visuals. If at all, it\&#39;s the show that launched Adrienne Curry into the spotlight. Curry has made a name for herself due to facts that have less to do with modeling as much as her theatric love-affair with one time child actor Christopher Knight in their very own reality soap opera.&#39;
b&#39;This movie turned out to be better than I had expected it to be. Some parts were pretty funny. It was nice to have a movie with a new plot.&#39;
b&#39;Logan Lerman &amp; Dean Collins III of Jack &amp; Bobby Fame provide a nice touch of familiarity as friends in this even if not maybe as close as they may be on Jack &amp; Bobby but the expressions of young students taking their stand for a good cause is very well expressed in this movie.Logan Lerman may be seemingly typecast in roles of being &#34;different&#34; as thusly seen from here as is seen in this as well as in Jack and Bobby.The Movie also opens up with a very nice tune coined as a lost 45 &#34;And I\&#39;m Wondering where the lions are?&#34;A song which I\&#39;d Always heard on the speaker @ my old Job of ChristmasTreeShops and got it played on my local radio show of The Lost45s hosted by Barry Scott but the last time of which I suggested this with this movie as it\&#39;s dedication but the dedication was left out.Environmentalist demonstration is well expressed in this movie too for the protection of the ground owls as seen in this movie too.What a hoot too this movie is.Hoot,Sogive a hoot in the tradition of the Woodsey Owl Commercials of the 1970s too. Truthfully, Stephen &#34;Steve&#34; G. Baer a.k.a.&#34;Ste&#34;.&#39;
b&#39;I\&#39;m not going to go into too much depth, but Showtime was a pretty funny movie. There wasn\&#39;t any slapping-your-knee funny scenes (that I can remember), but it had it\&#39;s moments. The cast is pretty good, Robert De Niro is good as usual and Eddie Murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance. Rene Russo was just fine in the film, no complaints there. There were two characters in the story that I liked that they didn\&#39;t explain much at all. The first one was Trey Sellars\&#39; (Eddie Murphy\&#39;s) buddy at the gym played by Ken Campbell. I supposed he was just a friend of Trey\&#39;s, but I wanted to know more about him. The other character that I liked was Mitch Preston\&#39;s (Robert De Niro\&#39;s) fellow cop/partner played by Nestor Serrano. I guess he was just another cop working with Mitch Preston, but I wanted to know if he was his partner or what not. I think maybe I\&#39;m putting too much thought into a movie, I mean after all, it\&#39;s a comedy...who cares about the characters? I guess I do though. I was really pleased to see this was directed by Tom Dey, who also directed Shanghai Noon. Ever since I saw that movie I was looking forward to his next work. I think he did a pretty good job with this film, and I again look forward to his next work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it was a good movie, but I wouldn\&#39;t recommend paying full price for a ticket unless you\&#39;re a die-hard Robert De Niro/Eddie Murphy/Rene Russo fan. It was worth seeing in the theater, but not for full price, I\&#39;d recommend seeing it at matinee price. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, here\&#39;s some movie trivia for ya. The guy who played the camera man, played by Judah Friedlander is the guy in the music video &#34;Everyday&#34; by Dave Matthews band. He was also the clerk in &#34;Meet The Parents&#34;, also starring Robert De Niro. ...And on top of that he also played Derek Zoolander\&#39;s brother in &#34;Zoolander&#34; (both Zoolander and Meet the Parents star Ben Stiller). Just some useless trivia for ya.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you enjoy the film. Thanks for reading,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Chris&#39;
b&#39;When I was engaged, my fiance and I would frequent the adult bookstores. He would look for his favorite mags, and on occasion a video that caught the eye. As much as I enjoyed the one-on-one with him that the media caused, there was never a video that I really enjoyed. I had seen only one other movie way back when there was a satellite channel called XXX (it dealt with a private eye unraveling a case) that actually had a proper plot and was enjoyable. All the others were grunting and puffing and blowing and whatnot. There\&#39;s only so many times you can watch a blonde bimbo faking \&#39;it\&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie caught my eye, and I migrated to it, allowing him to wander the shop. He noticed (how hard was it not too? grins. I was actually interested in something, lol(!) in the video section!) and came over, buying the slightly used copy for me. We took it home and I loved it. Here was a &#34;Porno&#34; with a plot. I wasn\&#39;t sure it even classified as porno, but I use the word loosely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The librarian was a character I could identify with. Alice rejected her boyfriend\&#39;s advances. She was not comfortable with her own sexuality and prudish in her comments. Bill went away, and she continued to check in books. The White Rabbit ran through the library (one book, if you notice closely, I believe (it\&#39;s been ten years since I saw the movie) was by Lewis C.) and Alice, for that same reason that propels teenagers to run into the woods when a chainsaw wielding maniac is behind them rather than towards populated areas, follows. It\&#39;s the best way to get the plot forward. Alice finds herself in Wonderland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I barely recall all the details, but I do remember clearly the swim in the lake, and how she was &#34;dried&#34; off. I liked how they got Humpty Dumpty Up again, the Mad Hatter\&#39;s size of member being on his hat to wear it proudly, and the brother sister team of Dum and Dee (which did disturb me slightly--then again, they could have been husband wife, but I never could tell no matter how many times I watched it). The woman on the knight who told Alice go away and find your own Knight (What\&#39;s a A Nice Girl Like You Doing on a Knight Like This?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The part that really caught my attention when I watched it about a year or so later was one of the cards (3 of hearts, I think) who resembled my ex\&#39;s current wife exactly! We couldn\&#39;t help but tease her about being in the movie! The King of Hearts was interesting, and the Queen was even more so. Due to the openness of the forum, I can\&#39;t go into details, just say it was &#34;orgy&#34; based and we\&#39;ll leave it at that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we split up, I was allowed to take the video--he knew I liked it--but in the time since it\&#39;s been lost in borrowing. Someday I\&#39;ll find another copy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, if anyone could tell me offlist what scene was cut from the Amazon version, I\&#39;d really appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heartily recommend this movie for the over 18 crowd. It was soft, sweet, and really 70\&#39;s, but I liked it immensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** out of 5. D.&#39;
b&#34;Nothing really unpredictable in this movie, but a solid flick in all respects. Everything from acting to cinematography was solid. Not a perfectly linear plot line, but there wasn&#39;t anything you couldn&#39;t see coming. Perhaps a tad melodramatic at points, but again, a fairly decent movie none the less. Definitely worth checking out. If in doubt of what film to rent over the weekend, give this a go. Though you may not feel like running out and buying it, I found it to be quite worth while.&#34;
b&#39;You cannot be seeing the same movie if you didn\&#39;t grow up in France (or spent at least 10 years there, like me). I don\&#39;t know if it will ever make it outside French cultural borders (I include Belgium and Luxembourg here). You cannot translate its kind of fun - every name is joke (how many people outside Paris would understand the pun in &#34;Couloirdebus&#34;, the name of one of the Roman legionnaires ?). However Monica Bel(l?)ucci is so beautiful, I almost forgot to breathe when I saw her.&#39;
b&#34;(WARNING - CONTAINS MILD SPOILER) A movie almost designed to make you pause and check your recollection of it - it&#39;s confined to an almost empty motel where the huge courtyard resembles a circus ring and the rooms seem like temporary withdrawal points rather than refuges; as the characters become increasingly preoccupied by the past, the present increasingly falls away, until the ultimate incendiary appearance of the Countess in the black Mercedes marks the fusion of reality and fantasy. Whether or not their stories are true, and whether Stanton is truly the father or just a crazy old man stepping into their stories, seems impossible to determine. The theme seems to be how love of an extreme and unconsidered nature messes with stability to the point where reality itself breaks down; where exotic, misplaced fantasy becomes dangerously tangible. The image of the burning motel - a symbol of dislocation beset by destruction - is an appropriately weird ending for this strange but effective, startlingly imaginative, movie.&#34;
b&#39;&#34;Labyrinth of Passion&#34;--with the possible exception of &#34;Matador &#34;--is Almodovar\&#39;s best film. It displays his unique personality at its best and least-censored, before he started going more mainstream. Almodovar is just about the only modern director that can approach Preston Sturges\&#39; wonderful brand of lunacy. It\&#39;s pointless to try and explain what the movie is about, the real point being Almodovar\&#39;s willingness and skill in taking his situations to the outer limits of sanity, and sometimes of plausibility and taste as well.&#39;
b&#34;Note: This should probably be read only after watching the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very rare to find a documentary or movie that focuses on the loser. Deep Water does just this, making it one of the most thought provoking films in a very long time. It does not provide us with a hero to look up to, but rather an anti-hero who forces us to look into ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is about a group of men who attempt to sail around the globe, singlehandedly, and without stopping. Only one makes it, several die, one decides not to return home, each of them on a psychological journey intriguing enough to merit entire films for themselves. Yet the most interesting is Donald Crowhurst, or rather the way that he is portrayed by the filmmakers and our reactions to him as viewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By any standards this man should be considered a despicable character, yet why is he depicted so heroically? Why are we so sympathetic to him? From the beginning he made all of the wrong choices. He risked his family financially to get the boat, he left at a more dangerous time to get more publicity, he ignored all of the warnings despite his lack of experience, he chose to lie instead of admitting defeat, these choices snowball until the inevitable and final one: suicide. All for what? A place in history? A feeling of accomplishment? Perhaps. What is important to consider is whether this mans situation was inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each individual must ask himself if his natural human drive for fame and accomplishment would bring him to such recklessness, and I believe that examining your own reaction to Crowhurst&#39;s story will offer at least some answer to that question.&#34;
b&#39;this is a great movie for all Corey Feldman fans. This movie has a great cast of young actors. a group of teens decide to rob a bank to get some quick cash, but all goes wrong when a security gaurd gets shot and they take hostages&#39;
b&#34;does anybody know why this movie is called the couch trip? i was just watching it and am still not sure why this title was picked the movie was very funny and its probably my favorite Dan Aykroyd performance it even beats out his Ghostbusters performance i had never heard of the movie before i seen it in a sears store i read the back and thought it sounded good so i bought and when i finally got a chance to watch it, i thought it was better than what i had originally expected. this movie rates as good as animal house and national lampoon&#39;s vacation in my mind i wish comedies that have come out lately were written as well as this one was nothing sad happens in it and the bad stuff that does happen are also funny parts if anyone else feels this way and would like to read a comedy script for a movie that doesn&#39;t have a sad situation in it email me at killer2511@hotmail.com&#34;
b&#34;I rented this film because it was a documentary and highly rated. It&#39;s more a study of a bastard son trying to find out who his biological father was, than anything about architecture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than anything else, the underlying theme of the movie is that we have an eccentric, highly praised, possibly genius architect who had little regard for anything or anyone outside is profession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tragedy of the film is the broken families he left. His baby-mothers came across more as scorned fans than irresponsible women, which can only have negative results on the children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, Nathaniel, the producer of the film and son of Louis Khan, came across as fairly stable and curious, if not bitter. The people he interviewed were of course more interested in talking about Louis Khan&#39;s buildings than his personal problems, but I find the mix of themes made the film interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for his buildings, I found them like abstract art - strange, non-practical, and usually only appreciated by so-called critics.&#34;
b&#34;Irene Jacob is mesmerizing in this final installment of Krzysztof Kieslowski&#39;s trilogy and the story is infinitely satisfying as it succeeds in tying all three films together. I am simply in awe of the amount of talent it took to do one of these stories, let alone all three. Everything seems to fit together so precisely, all the elements of filmmaking so eloquently executed, and the end result so much greater than the sum of the individual parts. Trois Couleurs is epic in nature and belongs on any list of great cinematic achievements. Simply brilliant!&#34;
b&#34;Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film. The fact that you keep seeking and hoping for more flying sequences, tells you that they have just enough. The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid.............&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must rent, view, or see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t be afraid of subtitles........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its worth a little aversion therapy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;
b&#39;Years ago when I first read John Irving\&#39;s The World According to Garp, I was astounded that most of the younger adults with whom I had contact didn\&#39;t like the book when I loved it. I began to understand that it was an age and experience thing. I experienced somewhat of a d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu when reading some of the comments on this site that were clearly written by younger viewers. Fully enjoying Separate Lies is surely an age and experience thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this film the viewer sees a seemingly happy upper middle class couple - he a successful lawyer - she the perfect wife of a successful lawyer. They have a townhouse in London and a home in the country. All\&#39;s well until there enters the &#34;villain&#34; in the guise of the son of the richest man in the village. This guy appears to be a cad from the word, &#34;Go.&#34; He is disdainful of everyone and everything including his own children. In the traditional form of nice guys finishing last, the lawyer\&#39;s wife engages in an affair with the bounder. You see the lawyer really is a nice guy but with the marriage killing trait of an organized perfectionist. Even though he truly loves her, he is boring his wife to death. The bad boy is far more exciting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of this is entangled with the hit-and-run death of a man in the village in which all the facts point to the cad being the driver of the vehicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s easy to determine that this movie doesn\&#39;t build to a happy ending, however, it does lead to a very satisfying ending in that the man and his wife learn and grow from their experiences and probably will be able to conduct their personal lives in a more successful manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three excellent actors play the main characters in this film, and it is there performances that make the whole thing a pleasure to watch. Tom Wilkinson is perfect as the husband. His portrayal shows us a kind man who has so much control over his emotions that he has lost touch with the world. Emily Watson shows us a woman who has become so trapped in the role of perfect wife that she has almost lost her knowledge of passion. That passion is reborn by the character deftly played by Rupert Everett.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have reached that point in life in which you understand that everyone has feet of clay and that everyone - even with the gifts of intelligence and opportunities - makes many many wrong decisions, then you will probably enjoy watching these excellent actors creating the lives of three such people. This is a beautifully acted and directed adult film about realistic adults.&#39;
b&#34;I saw this film when it was released to theaters. It&#39;s definitely one to remember, I had forgotten the title until recently. A friend found it via online search.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One Dark Night is rather unusual for the suspense/horror genre of the time in that it contains no blood. It is of the teen fright variety yet the teens are respectable in their own ways. It&#39;s a nice, old-school film with props and scenes that reflect the times. Our hero rides a motorcycle with no brain bucket, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As has been mentioned by previous reviewers, One Dark Night is currently available on DVD. The original negative was not available for the DVD transition. Some reel changes are a bit rough but this doesn&#39;t take away from the story. That being said, the colors are vibrant and the lighting is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam West plays a rather smallish part in this film as RayMar&#39;s son-in-law. His role as an overbearing and indifferent husband is thankfully short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story builds over the course of the film. Unlike many horror films of the era, One Dark Night is a great suspense story that gives the viewer time to absorb what is happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final 20 minutes or so of One Dark Night are what make it so memorable. RayMar&#39;s telekinetic abilities are used to open old graves in the mausoleum, pull the coffins out, open them and move the corpses around. Attention was afforded to great detail in the final scenes. The rotting, worm-riddled corpses look quite real.&#34;
b&#34;SPOILERS AHEAD\xc2\x97 For the first ten minutes or so of Star Witness we&#39;re introduced to a quote typical urban American family unquote in a nameless city, which is another way of saying Warner Brothers&#39; version of NYC. Except for the young children, including the charming Dickie Moore, and sprightly Sally Blane, they&#39;re a pretty dreary lot, and their dinner table conversation is tedious and we wish the story would move along and bring in the star, Walter Huston. But wait, folks, wait. All of a sudden serious gangster movie action breaks out, drawing the family in against their will, and after that this baby never lets up. There&#39;s suspense, an Oscar-nominated script, good acting; everything you want old movies to be\xc2\x97it is here. I do question Chic Sales performance; he must be an acquired taste, but his presence turns out to be crucial to the plot. He&#39;s treated to special status in the credits, so Warner Bros. must have really been high on Sale, but how his corny old man routine fit in with the public then is something lost to me. Perhaps it is lost to time period, an unknowable factor you had to be a 1931 moviegoer to understand. Also, the climax is typically melodramatic. Nevertheless, this right now is the best release of the studio that year I have seen so far (however, I&#39;ve only seen eight, so perhaps that&#39;s an inconclusive view). Do not miss this when TCM shows it. 8 out of 10.&#34;
b&#39;Farscape is the best sci-fi show period, for one main reason, everything the show attempts, it does very well. From a technical aspect, the music is original and perfectly fitted to the show. The special effects are abundance and higher quality then almost any thing else that you will see on your tv. The acting is also great, too many shows nowadays use only the American market of actors for their shows. Remember the first time you saw The Matrix and you said, wow where did that Agent Smith come from? Its the same feeling that you get watching Claudia Black, Anthony Simcoe, Lani Tupu, Virginia Hey, and especially Wayne Pygram. These Aussies are great and it comes through in this great show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is second to none. The next closest thing I can think of is Babylon 5 during the shadow wars episodes, but this tops even that. Its a real treat getting to watch all the episodes sequential again, the intricacies of the interpersonal relationships of the characters are well scripted and performed. The overall plot is both original and thoroughly entertaining. I am always itching for the next show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comedic episodes are funny, the drama episodes are touching, and the action sequences are tense. The beginning of the second season had some great comedic episodes which had me laughing aloud, something that rarely happens while watching television that is not South Park, Sealab 2021, or Seinfeld. The drama is even harder, whether Crichton is meeting his mother or the characters face thier mortality, all is done with heart and intensity. Lastly it goes without saying that the action is tops. This is sci-fi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a fan of science fiction in the slightest, if you enjoy good television at all, if you like good serialized plot, you owe it to yourself to watch Farscape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and Ben Browder owns.&#39;
b&#34;The movie Haggard is one of the funniest movies of all time. It features the cast from CKY (the movies) and also has a GREAT soundtrack. If you have seen any CKY or Viva La Bam you will notice that everybody (from those two) are in it. Including Bam&#39;s parents and many other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is about Ryan Dunn&#39;s girlfriend Glauren (Jennifer Rivall) cheating on him, and him trying to get back at her. He does this by having Valo (Bam) and Falcone (Dicamillo) vandalize her house. There are many different characters with many different stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is great music on the soundtrack. Bands such as Him &amp; Her, CKY, Gnar Kill, Daniel Lioneye. Iggy and the Stooges Pop, and New Order. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not like Viva La Bam or CKY (the movies) I doubt you will like this. If you DO like that stuff...this movie is great.&#34;
b&#39;It was a movie that made ya think a little. Some parts a little cheesy, some parts pretty good. Plot did thicken at times and just when you thought Angella (Sandra) found a friend the friend was fraud or dead. All I got to say is that DENNIS MILLER should have been in the whole movie. His character was the best, very refreshing after all the crap Angella went through. He would have lifted me and Angella through the dumps.&#39;
b&#34;Well, first of all, it&#39;s not a bad movie. It is good, and I like the characters introduced. I also like Lady and Tramp&#39;s voices more in this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I would like to see Lady And Tramp more. I know it says &#39;Scamp&#39;s Adventure&#39;, and I love Scamp And Angel to bits, but it&#39;s a sequel to the original, where in my opinion, they should of just released it as &#39;Scamp&#39;s Adventure&#39;, not &#39;Lady And The Tramp II:Scamp&#39;s Adventure&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tramp did have quite a role, but he didn&#39;t have much time with Lady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But anyway, the songs are quite good, and Scamp and Angel are sweet. I&#39;ve seen better sequels, but hey, it&#39;s not a failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 7/10. Very good, but still had flaws.&#34;
b&#39;This adaptation for TV was a wonderful vehicle for Bill Irwin to show his ability to perform physical humor. With the backdrop of a struggle between an actor and his writer/director, Bill uses his clowning antics to showcase a variety of skills including hat tricks, pantomime, dance and various physical devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it takes a big swipe at the entertainment industry and his craft, it is engrossing for people of all walks and ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This work was televised as a PBS special. Bill performed a piece of it on the Tonight Show, but out of context it did not go over well.&#39;
b&#34;When THE CHINA SYNDROME was released, plenty of right-wing critics and pro-nuke supporters blasted this film, particularly since its three leading stars were all known for their liberal politics and their overt distrust of nuclear power. But it only took two weeks and a near-catastrophic accident at Three Mile Island to shut those critics up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fonda and Douglas are the L.A. news crew that witness a potentially nasty accident at the Ventana nuclear power plant. Douglas films the event through the plant&#39;s soundproof glass; but the TV station will not air the footage, fearing a massive lawsuit. It is thus up to Fonda and Douglas to get at the truth, despite a massive attempt by the plant&#39;s owners to cover up the accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a conscientious shift supervisor (Jack Lemmon) has uncovered certain defects in the plant&#39;s pump support structure. He believes that these defects were the cause of the accident and that, though it would be extremely costly and lengthy, if repairs aren&#39;t made, the next accident could be apocalyptic. But he can&#39;t get anyone who works with him to believe his story. The result is a nightmarish climax that pulls various political, technological, and human interest stories together in one disturbing package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While obviously quite politically liberal in nature, THE CHINA SYNDROME, well directed and co-written by James Bridges (THE PAPER CHASE), is also fundamentally a message movie about the inherent dangers of putting technology and nuclear power together. Fundamentally, nuclear power can NEVER be made safe because people can NEVER be perfect. That is what the film is saying; and in a highly entertaining and suspenseful way, it says it brilliantly.&#34;
b&#39;keys to the VIP is BS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rob cavaliere vs Justin in season two. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to school with rob cavaliere and Adriana Doria. you may remember her as the last girl he was &#34;picking up&#34;. this was when the &#34;angry girlfriend&#34; came by, they made out and &#34;left the club together&#34;. They were good friends at father bressani chs in woodbridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;whether or not rob planned it or they asked him to do it, men should know that what they are seeing is not real and the guys on here are douche bags. especially that episode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one more line to fill space.&#39;
b&#39;First of all I have to say that I\&#39;m a huge Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento fan. Although I have not seen absolutely all of their movies, I really enjoyed almost every one I did see. I really like giallos and I thought Argento was the master of this genre, after seeing films like &#34;Tenebre&#34; and &#34;Phenomena&#34;. But after I saw &#34;New York Ripper&#34; by Fulci, I found out that he could do pretty good giallos besides his graphic zombie movies and even outdo Argento, on a certain level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Fulci\&#39;s style, and yes I love gore, but this film I think, although it has a more developed plot and characters than his other films, is not his best one. What I don\&#39;t like is that it can be confusing at times, especially at the end. And the fact that we go from one suspect, to another, and then another until we even suspect the retarded little girl for a moment, I think it goes too far. I know giallos are supposed to keep you guessing until the end, and the killer should be very hard to find, but this film plays a little too much with our minds. However I did like the scene when the witch is killed, I think it is very well done and gave me the chills. The acting is also pretty good and the photography is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this is not a bad film, I think Lucio Fulci has made better films than this, and I think his best one is &#34;The Beyond&#34;, a very different movie but a more atmospheric and visual experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give &#34;Don\&#39;t torture a duckling&#34; a 7 out of 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;
b&#34;This is definitely the biggest surprise of the festival so far and without a doubt the best the festival has had to offer. I went into this film with little to no expectations after learning that the director was responsible for the awful vampire flick The Forsaken. and I left pleasantly surprised. The film stars Lori heuring of In Crowd fame as a young mother whose husband has just passed. She moves into an old family home in the mountains with her two daughters next to a mine that is a gravesite to overworked children back in the day. Unlucky for them the children return with a vengeance killing and eating everyone in their path. The film works on many levels. It&#39;s well done, suspenseful, it has spots of good cinematography and capable performances by Compton especially. The atmosphere is spooky yet slightly underwhelming, the score is decent and the makeup effects are gruesome and simplistic. The film keeps up a creepy and unsettling tone and the kids themselves with pale skin, torn up lips and hollow eyes are pretty scary and unrelenting. The film is original and inventive without being to artsy or complicated. I can&#39;t see this film making it into a wide release without some trimming and slight fine tuning. But they definitely have a good product on there hands and should pursue some type of theatrical distribution. However the theatre in which i saw it in was horrible. The sound was dreadfully messed up which i felt took away from the film majorly and it stopped in the middle because they couldn&#39;t center it on the screen which killed the mood a bit. All in all though it was the most satisfying of horrorfests entries maybe because it had the least expectations but nonetheless was a welcome addition to genre films.&#34;
b&#39;i watch this film with horror in my heart because my mother also was a crack head like Michelle. i\&#39;ve been wondering where Michelle is now. there has been times where i had to find my mother in places i was scared to be but more scared to leave her there! to see Michelle act like that made me wonder where she was sleeping all that time?? i watched in hopes the it was never that bad for my mom! and what i want to know is... where did Matt and Tracy &#34;tear that ass up&#34;?! worst scene for me was watching Tracy shoot up in an old navy dressing room!!!! u never who try clothes on before you and it looks like all of them except Michelle has aids!!!! where are they know 2008? can we get an update??????????&#39;
b&#39;I gave this show a chance because of Jaleel White, not for his Urkel character, but mainly for the Sonic the Hedgehog voice XD So anyway, like I said, I gave it a chance, and I was very fond of it. I never cared for the Urkel character, so I was pleased to see Mr. White in a role other than the ever-so-annoying nerd. And his Calvin J. Fraiser (first called Calvin, but come the second episode, everyone started calling him &#34;J&#34;) was very entertaining and interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my favorite episode was when J was dating the ex-Cowboys cheerleader with the snobby kid. (&#34;Don\&#39;t you talk that way \&#39;bout my momma!&#34; &#34;This is grown-up talk, you stay down there!&#34;) The only beef I have is that the show was suppose to have 3 main characters, but Mr. White\&#39;s character always seemed to have the most attention and the other two (who are married) always had the back stories... It isn\&#39;t exactly a good thing when a story about those two possibly being pregnant takes backseat to J. having to babysit his girlfriend\&#39;s dog.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I really wish this show could have lasted a little longer. Unfortunetely, it seems that people weren\&#39;t interested in Jaleel White as something other than the God-Awful annoying ass nerd known as Urkel....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope they at least put it out as a DVD box set.&#39;
b&#34;I actually caught an ad for JAPAN SINKS in a Japanese magazine last year, and wondered what the heck it was until I saw the trailer for the film. It was then I remembered that I had seen the English translation of Sakyo Komatsu&#39;s novel some years back. I got it, and it was quite good, as well as chillingly realistic. It&#39;s enough to make the reader dread hearing any news about earthquakes in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#39;ve read the book, and seen this 2006 movie version (the first movie came out in 1973). And you know what? I thought the movie was quite good, even if there are major changes from novel to film (but that&#39;s understandable). The story is simple--a major tectonic shift will cause Japan to sink within a year. Massive earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis rock the country as frantic efforts are made to evacuate as many people as possible. One scientist has a plan that could stop the sinking of the country and save what&#39;s left of the landmass, but can it be implemented in time? I saw JAPAN SINKS at Otakon 2007, and while there were a couple of problems I had with it--it does run a bit too long, and a couple of the character moments were a little too sappy--I was nonetheless blown away. The sheer concept of an entire nation sinking into the sea was made terrifyingly real, and the effects were some of the best I&#39;ve ever seen, rivaling anything that Hollywood has done. The film also plays no favorites with the main characters, with some not making it to the closing credits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I&#39;ve been surprised by some of the negative comments made about this film. Difference of opinions, I guess. Personally, I enjoyed it. And I&#39;ve read the original book.&#34;
b&#39;This sci-fi great fortunately has little to do with the first one. Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.&#39;
b&#39;I have used this movie in my college Ethics courses for over 10 years (also Woody Allen\&#39;s &#34;Crimes and Misdemeanors&#34;--another terrific, multi-leveled ethical study). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s fiction. I don\&#39;t focus too much on the unrealistic features of &#34;Strangers&#34; because all fictional films are obviously false on many levels. I love the film as gallows comedy, tautly told, with many ironic twists and visual pleasures--even if it\&#39;s &#34;unbelievable.&#34; The story is told so well that I don\&#39;t even think of criticizing its plausibility (although I must confess that the tennis match seems the weakest part to me--too much Hollywood fluff and not enough real tennis competition).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some problems presented in the film that hold promise for realistic moral education and ethical discussion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Ethical Passivity: some weaknesses of the Guy character are intended by Hitchcock. A primary ethical insight of the film is the danger of inability to articulate one\&#39;s moral positions. Guy is unable to effectively block Bruno\&#39;s crazy proposals at the start. An interesting question is why and how does Guy behave so passively, ineffectively? A possible answer is his depression because of his intense and complicated divorce process. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Miscommunication: Guy commits another failure at the start: on the train, to get away quickly, he agrees that Bruno\&#39;s ideas are all good. But Guy\&#39;s literal meaning is opposite to his inflected, sarcastic meaning. Bruno takes the literal meaning as an agreement for the criss-cross murders. Guy takes the sarcastic meaning as an escape from any murder agreement. To some extent, near the beginning, Bruno may be partially pretending that an agreement has been struck, to draw Guy further into a web of complicity. Bruno is manipulating Guy; Guy\&#39;s linguistic ambiguity on the train gives Bruno a chance to put an ethical &#34;stranglehold&#34; on Guy. Bruno manipulating Guy may also take on other meanings . . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Secrecy: Some have speculated about a sexual relationship between Guy and Bruno. It seems at first ridiculous, especially since Guy appears obviously heterosexual in his relationships with Miriam and Anne. However, remember that Guy is also ineffective with both women. Guy appears (stereotypically--it\&#39;s 1951 remember) effeminate, especially in relationship to Bruno. Guy, the strong athlete, is weak on the inside. Bruno is also conflicted (playing &#34;against himself&#34;), appearing facially and physically strong at first but then displaying some &#34;effeminate&#34; traits (Bruno\&#39;s fashion and footwork; his gushing emotionally to Guy in different situations; his receiving a manicure from his doting mother; Bruno kissing and desperately fondling his mother\&#39;s hand; other more subtle gay stereotypes that hold cryptic meaning from Hitchcock\&#39;s point of view). I wish I could hear Hitchcock clarify his intended meanings here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Dishonesty and Distrust: Guy makes some colossal blunders in hiding truths about Bruno from family and from police. Guy fails to fully comprehend that admitting fault quickly may be better than a cover-up or a delay in confession. Again Guy is driven by passivity, insecurity, fear--and perhaps a self-hate that is closer to Bruno\&#39;s own self-loathing than we care to see or to admit. Both Guy and Bruno act out their own parables of impotence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Lack of Evidence: Guy feels a problem mustering the evidence to acquit himself. While quickly going to the police would solve a huge problem, Guy traps himself with his own doubts and insecurities: the absence of desired alibis; the inability of the alcoholic professor to testify on Guy\&#39;s behalf; the obsessive need to appear politically pristine; and other personality factors that cause Guy to feel defenseless. He is as dysfunctional as Bruno--just not as dangerous (yet one could partially blame Guy for Miriam\&#39;s murder).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Disease and Mental Disorder: an interesting question is how legally responsible is Bruno for the murders? The more ethically incompetent Bruno is as a sick sociopath, the more guilty Guy may be as someone healthy who failed to stand up and morally act to prevent the crimes. Guy\&#39;s failure is like a man who fails to call the police when a sick friend threatens suicide, and death ensues. One could argue that more than one crime is committed and that Guy is an emotionally hobbled accomplice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These and many other features of the film make &#34;Strangers on a Train&#34; a gem of a morality play, a diamond for philosophical and cinematic reflections.&#39;
b&#34;It&#39;s Bad for Ya really showcases more of George Carlin&#39;s talents. He really is still as sharp as a tack. It is a shame that we lost him this past year, but his comedy will forever live on. This stand-up special is literally one of the funniest I have ever heard a comedian perform. Even though he is making fun of small children, it just makes you laugh the way he says some of the stuff. It is true that Carlin can literally make something that seems unfunny and turn it into one of the funniest things you have ever and will ever hear. I really enjoyed this stand-up particularly from Carlin and recommend that those that liked this check out more of George Carlin&#39;s stand-up.&#34;
b&#39;This is definitely one of the ultimate cult classics, and is a must see for all psychotronic fans. Why? It has everything a great 70s exploitation film should have. Over-the-top dialog, bad acting, enthusiasm, sex, sleaze, political incorrectness, violence, and many other elements of a good cult classic are included. In other words, Dolemite is a must-see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with a lot of these films, the plot makes little to no sense. What I picked up from it is that pimp-hustler Dolemite got framed up for having stolen furs and half a million dollars worth of narcotics. While he was doing time, his arch nemesis Willie Green (the same man who framed him) took over his nightclub. However, the sympathetic warden (the only white character in the whole movie that isn\&#39;t completely evil or incompetent) decides to spring him free to stop the evil Willie Green and his drug trafficking. Luckily, he knows kung fu, as does about 50 to 75% of the characters in this film do. And even more luckily, while he was locked up, the madam Queen Bee sent all his &#34;hoes&#34; to kung fu school. With this army of kung fu fighting &#34;hoes&#34; (his words, not mine) on his side, he plans to take back the nightclub from Willie Green. However, two racist white cops try to frame him up again and have him thrown back in jail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said earlier, don\&#39;t try to follow the plot. I\&#39;ve seen this movie about five times and there are many elements that seem to have no connections to anything else. Supporting characters wander in and out of the film. I\&#39;m still attempting to figure out what was up with Reverend Gibbs, the Mayor, and the Hamburger Pimp. Who cares ultimately? The scenes with these characters are all priceless. As for the dialog, its horrible with even worse delivery. Since Rudy Ray Moore was originally a comedian, I begin to wonder if this film was meant to be a spoof or a serious action film. It seems he couldn\&#39;t decide which one. Lines such as &#34;Yeah, I\&#39;m so bad, I kick my own ass twice a day&#34; call for further investigation. Either way, the film is hilarious, and the plot has more holes than a swiss cheese factory. Another hilarious element is some of the most unerotic uses of sex and nudity ever in film. Actors that you would never want to see naked get naked (including the Mayor and Queen Bee). Not to mention the fact that the boom mic seems to show up in every other scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of all, Moore shows incredible enthusiasm. He seems to be having a generally good time and is certainly charismatic. His comedy raps proved to be a huge influence on latter day gangsta rap, including Dr. Dre who sampled him on his groundbreaking 1992 album &#34;The Chronic&#34;. As technically inept as the film is, it is culturally influential. Even more important, it is an all around good time. The biggest crime an exploitation film can commit is being boring, and this for all its flaws is quickly paced and entertaining. In other words, if you dig this kind of film, you\&#39;ll love &#34;Dolemite&#34;. If you don\&#39;t dig it, you\&#39;re a &#34;no-business, born-insecure, jock-jawed motha-f***a!&#34; (7/10)&#39;
b&#39;If you are one of those people that think Lucio Fulci is all about gore, guts and zombies, you have to watch this (and &#34;The Psychic&#34; too, for that matter). Even though the film does include some quite brutal scenes of violence, and a unsettling subject matter, it\&#39;s not the main thing here. This is a truly impressive, story and character-driven murder mystery that might well be the director\&#39;s masterpiece. Here, he proves that he\&#39;s a real craftsman, creating a memorable, disturbing yet strikingly beautiful masterpiece, filled with creepy Catholic imagery and interesting social commentary. It also has a great cast, including the gorgeous Barbara Bouchet, as well as Tomas Millan (from Beatrice Cenci) and Irene Pappas in a small but important role. Still, it is Brazilian actress Florinda Bolkan (who also stared in Fulci\&#39;s bizarre &#34;Lizard in a woman\&#39;s skin&#34;) who steals the scene in the role of Majara, giving an excellent performance of a woman driven insane by her superstitions, and her vicious murder scene is particularly heartbreaking. The second star of the movie is Sergio D\&#39;Ofizi\&#39;s cinematography who, along with the melancholic Morricone-esquire score by Riz Ortolani, help bringing the &#34;secluded Italian village with a dark secret&#34; setting to life. I have to admit thought that the dummy head hitting the rocks kind of pulled me off, but nonetheless, this is a definite Italian horror classic - a moving, sad and ultimately thought provoking work of genius. 10/10 for me. If you liked this one, I recommend watching Alfred Sole\&#39;s &#34;Alice, Sweet Alice&#34;, as they are somewhat similar, and are both underrated gems.&#39;
b&#34;I know not why people considered it trashy or obnoxious; It&#39;s not like American Pie or something. I know not why people are offended by the Universal plugs; since it&#39;s part of the plot, the advertising is excusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a funny movie with good dialogue, good subtle wit, a good story, a good moral (that thankfully doesn&#39;t get too sappy), GREAT acting, and a cheesy ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(minor spoiler) The basic premise here is the classic story of a Shepherd boy (Muniz) who lies so much that no one believes him when the Wolf (Giamatti) comes along. So he gets his best friend Kaylee (Bynes) and they go and drive the Wolf crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankie Muniz can be annoying in other roles, but not as Jason Shepherd. He handles the suave confidence of his character perfectly well, and what appears to be a lack of expression at first glance is really a perfectly executed nonchalantness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amanda Bynes. What more can I say? The girl&#39;s got the gift. She&#39;s funny, talented, versatile, and very, very attractive. (I&#39;m only 6 months older than her. I need to get to California sometime soon.) In fact, the &#39;best-friend&#39; part was originally a boy, but became a girl as soon as the makers saw Amanda&#39;s interest. Which works out pretty well, since the part would&#39;ve been pretty dull without the blessing of Bynes&#39;s abilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Giamatti is a very talented man. While some would play Marty Wolf as evil and diabolical, Giamatti made him-not just a jerk, mind you, but a LIKEABLE jerk, a jerk that livens up the screen, rather than intentionally dimming it. And I doubt many other actors could pull off the psychological breakdown that Wolf undergoes as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, great movie. Loved seeing Jaleel White able to mock himself. Loved seeing all the little references &amp; such built into the film. (one of the guests in the party scene is the director, Shawn Levy, another is Bynes&#39;s former co-star Kenan Thompson) Loved seeing Amanda in those outfits........ Get the DVD if you can. It&#39;s got all kinds of great extra stuff, and the lovely Ms. Bynes is your guide through the menus. :)&#34;
b&#39;Soul\&#39;s Midnight stars Armande Assante (Simon) who stared in &#34;The Mambo Kings&#34; and Elizabeth Bennett (Alicia Milford). Together with Sexy vampire vixen, Lucila Sola (Iris), Simon lures pregnant Alicia and her husband Charles into the netherworld of Soul\&#39;s Midnight. Assante sinks his fangs into the script by writers Brian and Jason Cleveland and you enjoy watching him and Iris kill. Alicia and Charles (Robert Floyd) try to stay alive while gore keeps your lust for blood sated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(spoiler alert) In today\&#39;s jaded landscape, it comes as no surprise that a back-stabbing preacher gets bitten. Set looks cool \xc2\x96 lots of detail at the Borgo Hotel and cool special effects at the end. I had a lot of fun watching this movie \xc2\x96 it doesn\&#39;t take itself too seriously and looks great.&#39;
b&#39;Big Fat Liar is what you get when you combine terrific writing, great production, and an emphasis on clever ideas over adolescent pap. The two stars work great together, and--what can I say? Amanda Bynes shines. Putting &#34;Irkel&#34; and Lee Majors in the film were brilliant touches. Watch this film with your kids. If you don\&#39;t laugh throughout it, you must not have been paying attention.&#39;
b&#39;Normally, movies stay out of the realm of &#34;domestic drama,&#34; and for good reason: who wants to intentionally seek entertainment from a story about what they or those close to them have to deal with in real life? Divorce hurts an incredible percentage of American families of all classes and custody battles are ugly and necessary parts of it. That\&#39;s not escapism -- the number one reason the average person turns to movies -- that\&#39;s sad reality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, divorce or custody is simply part of a greater story and affects the way we understand it or relate to its characters. &#34;Kramer vs. Kramer&#34; focuses on it and asks us to understand why we do it and why that makes it so troubling. That\&#39;s a challenge for both this film and its audience: turn something so real into something that can capture our attention and then make us not feel spiteful as the mirror is held up to our face. Writer/director Robert Benton definitely achieves both and in impressive fashion in adapting this novel by Avery Corman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story, as one would expect, is quite simple: Big business advertising man Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) comes home to find his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) is leaving him and their 7-year-old son Billy (Justin Henry). Ted then must quickly learn to be an active father in the boys\&#39; life and as soon as he does, Joanna brings a custody suit upon him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make an Oscar-winning drama about something so generic and particularly dialogue- heavy first takes tremendous acting talent. You don\&#39;t get much better than Hoffman and Streep. Hoffman is in his prime in this role: his first Oscar win after three other notable nominations. He creates a thorough character, one whose self-centered and quick-tempered ways clearly change as he learns to be a better father and the sole care-giver. Streep wins her first Oscar in only the second major role of her career as a woman who doesn\&#39;t get much screen time but must communicate both inner torment at her decision to leave as well as renewed sense of identity when she returns to take custody. Streep does so effortlessly. The young boy, Justin Henry, who at his age was the youngest competitive category nominee in Academy Awards history, plays the embodiment of all 7-year-old children exceptionally well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benton\&#39;s writing and direction takes these performances to the level where we see deeper into this family\&#39;s troubles than we do our own and thus reconsider our thoughts about love and raising a family. Benton\&#39;s previous notable credits (&#34;Bonnie &amp; Clyde&#34; and &#34;Superman&#34;) wouldn\&#39;t indicate a strong command of family drama, but the man can flat out write. Numerous scenes give us strong visuals that show us much more than the typical family scenarios they depict. The first morning that Joanna is gone and Ted make\&#39;s Billy french toast is a classic that perfectly demonstrates all the talent going into this movie in a scene that happens in Americans\&#39; kitchens every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You\&#39;ll rarely see a story as straightforward as &#34;Kramer vs. Kramer&#34; done better. There aren\&#39;t any surprises at the end or twists and turns that will keep us desperately glued to the screen. The film then has to rely on its talents and they are all sure-fire, delivering a new understanding of a subject that\&#39;s so familiar.&#39;
b&#39;Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) lives her life through soap Opera &#34;A Reason to Love&#34; as a way to escape her slob husband and dull life. After a shocking incident involving two hit men (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), Betty goes into shock and travels to LA, believing that she is destined to marry the show\&#39;s main character (Greg Kinnear).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nurse Betty is that rare thing, a lesser known film with an all-star cast and a fluffy Rom-Com plot that surprises with it\&#39;s terrific script and spot on acting. Indeed, such a plot makes one question the R rating, but it\&#39;s warranted all right. The shocking incident that sends Betty over the edge is a tad too graphic compared to the light, amusing comedy that is to come and feels like something out of a different movie, but at the same time it is necessary to believably show Betty\&#39;s transformation into the doe eyed, lovable nut job she becomes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we go along with Betty on her journey, director Neil LaBute works some extraordinary magic which makes the movie unique and high above your bog standard comedy of error. An example of this would be Betty\&#39;s first meeting with her crush. She pours her heart out to him and he plays along, thinking she\&#39;s auditioning for a part on the show. Even as we are aware of the ludicrous nature of Betty\&#39;s ramblings, the music swells as she speaks, giving us, the audience, Betty\&#39;s emotional perspective. We almost believe what she is saying, yet we understand that her mind is fractured. Whereas other filmmakers would try to accent the ridiculousness of the situation to wring every ounce of possible comedy out of the scene, LaBute is sensitive to his main character and treats her with the utmost sympathy and understanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The banter between the hit men played by Freeman and Rock is priceless, the excellent script doling out clever line after clever line for them to riff off of. Freeman in particular is excellent as always, pacing himself as his character slowly and blindly falls in love with his own ideal of Betty, not even truly knowing who she is or what has happened to her. Aaron Eckhart once again shows versatility in the thankless role of Betty\&#39;s no-good husband and he is almost unrecognisable. The other revelation here is Kinnear, whose portrayal of the soap\&#39;s star is not too overcooked. There\&#39;s a tendency to lay on the celebrity bastard clich\xc3\xa9 as thickly as possible, and Kinnear resists, instead imbuing him with a pompous yet restrained self importance, despite simply being a soap star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap opera is realised so well, it could almost exist. LaBute and co hit the nail on the head with this one and a good thing too. If the soap opera had been too satirical, a large part of the film would not have worked. To do a &#34;Days of Our Lives&#34; spoof as seen in Friends would have been the wrong move for this movie. The dedication to detail pays off, as the style and feel of the soap opera begins to bleed into Betty\&#39;s reality more and more, while keeping with the overall unintentionally comedic aspect of the genre. The scenes on the set feel real, as opposed to some films in which the atmosphere feels so manufactured, you wondered why people who do it for a living can\&#39;t get it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The neat resolution of the final act, while being a tad predictable, is wholly satisfying overall. It\&#39;s a shame that after LaBute directed this wonderful film, the mainstream came calling for him to direct the abysmal remake of The Wicker Man, a fine example of a man so totally above the material given to him. Unfortunately, one cannot absolve him of all responsibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven\&#39;t seen Nurse Betty, it\&#39;s something to discover. If you have, it\&#39;s worth a re-visit. There is a charm to Nurse Betty that is infectious, even if it may not leave you thinking that much afterwards. A hidden gem nonetheless.&#39;
b&#39;Sam Elliot is brilliant as a tough San Francisco Detective Charlie Fallon. When his partner is killed while meeting with an informant Fallon snaps, beats the informant to death, and dumps his body in a river. The next day Fallon is assigned a rookie partner, and given the task of investigating the informants murder. Sam Elliot does a good job of portraying a man who tortured by the guilt of his own murderous actions, and grief over the death of his partner who may have been involved in police corruption.&#39;
b&#34;80&#39;s comedies (especially ones with John Cusak) are awesome. Almost all are hillarious and instant classics and this film is no exception. Plenty of nods to other films (i.e. Godzilla and Jaws) through out the movie that are so hillarious you&#39;ll be laughing for hours. Some may complain that the movie is a little corny at times but hey it was the 80&#39;s and things were always a little cheesy. Throw in a young Demi Moore and an even louder Bob Cat and you have a laughfest on your fans. If you haven&#39;t seen this, you better soon!!!!!!&#34;
b&#39;If I was only allowed to watch one program in my entire life, I would definitely have to pick &#34;The Chaser\&#39;s War on Everything&#34;. Of all the satirical shows that have been on Australian television, I found &#34;Chaser&#34; to be the funniest of all. It is just so Amazing, the boys aren\&#39;t afraid to do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether it\&#39;s dress up as Hitler to get into a Polish Club, or push a MASSIVE ball of string around Melbourne to try out the tourism ad\&#39;s or rock up to the Coke factory naked in a bath with $2.40 to buy some water. The Chaser boys will go there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In agreement with the comments above (and/or below) &#34;The Chaser\&#39;s War on Everything&#34; is more popular than their previous program &#34;CNNNN&#34;. But CNNNN was just as funny. Some unforgettable moments from that show... Clean up Cambodia!!! Classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway to stop me from Ranting further, I STRONGLY advise you to at least give Chaser a chance, you\&#39;ll more than likely find it HILARIOUS!!!!&#39;
b&#34;I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to watch this movie. But at the earnest request of my friend who is an ardent fan of Aparna Sen, I decided to turn up for the movie. Going at this cheap theater really bothered me, cos I had seen King Kong for 50 bucks at one of the best theatres in town. Anywasy the movie starts of and surprisingly I wasn&#39;t complaining. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great story and some really wonderful wonderful acting on Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma&#39;s part. Shabana Azmi a divorc\xc3\xa9e who has dedicated her life to the well being of her mother and step sister. Konkona Sen Sharma a schizophrenic(spare me the spelling), who imagines thing all the time. Rahul Bose also gives a stellar performance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is that Mithi (Sen Sharma) is a schizophrenic, and after getting brutally raped on her field job as a reporter, her levels really increase, her fianc\xc3\xa9e leaves her, for the person she became. In all her world comes down upon her. Shabana Azmi, her elder step sister, takes care of her, and Mithi in her imagination believes that she has been married to her fianc\xc3\xa9e, has 5 children and they stay in 15th Park Avenue (which really is a place in New York). The plot goes on as Mithi becomes suicidal, as she believe no one believes her and she is being held captive in her home from her husband. As fate would have, Mithi and her fianc\xc3\xa9e meet up when they both are out on a trip. 11 years after the brutal rape, her fianc\xc3\xa9e has no existence in her real world, she cant recognize him. Her fianc\xc3\xa9e, now married and a father of two children feels it is his duty to correct the wrong he did 11 years earlier and he promises to take her to Park Avenue. and he does. He takes her to a place in Kolkata which supposedly looks like her husband&#39;s home. As Joydeep/Jojo(Rahul Bose), her fianc\xc3\xa9e is talking on his cell phone he loses track of Mithi. Everyone comes looking for her but she is nowhere to be found. She finally gets what was denied to her, her family, her own imaginative family in her own world at 15th Park Avenue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, that it touched my heart. I myself am now a fan of Aparna Sen&#39;s direction. The camera work is superb. And the quality of performance is spell bounding. Konkona Sen Sharma gives a solid performance as the schizophrenic child. Shabana Azmi gives another mind blowing role as the divorc\xc3\xa9e elder sister, who has the load of keeping the family. Rahul Bose, another neat and quiet role(I don&#39;t know why this guy doesn&#39;t get big breaks, he has so much potential). Lastly Aparna Sen, she still captivates the audience, even if she is not in front of the camera and behind it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very well deserved 8/10....&#34;
b&#39;In the Universal series of modern Sherlock Holmes stories with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE SECRET WEOPON is not one of the top films - although it is entertaining. I think the problem with it is that much of the film\&#39;s &#34;dueling&#34; between Holmes and his nemesis Moriarty (here played by Lionel Atwill) seems to delay the actual point of the Professor\&#39;s work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moriarty appears in three of the Holmes films with Rathbone. In THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES he was played by George Zucco, who gave real relish to the love of villainy for its own sake to the role. For my money Zucco\&#39;s performance as the Professor was the best of the three (there is even a brief moment of comedy in his performance, when he\&#39;s disguised as the &#34;Sergeant of Police&#34; towards the end - like he\&#39;s preparing to sing &#34;A Policeman\&#39;s Lot&#34; from Gilbert &amp; Sullivan). Next comes Mr. Atwill\&#39;s performance here - more of that later. Finally there is Henry Daniell\&#39;s intellectual Moriarty in SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE LADY IN GREEN. It\&#39;s a typically cool, classy performance by Mr. Daniell, but his confrontations with Holmes seem to be a tedious bore to him. They keep him from completing the main plan. In the stories that the Professor pops up in, he really senses Holmes is a nemesis who will remain a danger as long as he is alive. Yet, because of the intellectual tennis match between him and Rathbone, Rathbone (in his autobiography) actually felt Daniell was the best of the film Moriartys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Zucco captured the love of evil in the Professor, and Daniell seemed to demonstrate the tired Oxford Don (in the stories the Professor is a well regarded mathematician, whose volume on the binomial theorem had a &#34;European vogue&#34;, and who wrote an intriguing book, THE DYNAMICS OF THE ASTEROID), Atwill demonstrates the Professor as pragmatic businessman. First of all, he\&#39;s sold his services (apparently) to Nazi Germany. This is never gone into, but one presumes (as this is before the Nazis began to really collapse) he figures they will win the war. Secondly, he is not a fool. When Dr. Tobel (William Post Jr.) has shown he is a state of near physical collapse due to the torturing of Moriarty\&#39;s gang, the Professor decides to kidnap one of the other scientists who are assisting Tobel, because he\&#39;s as good a scientist as Tobel and would be able to put together the bomb site. I somehow can\&#39;t quite see Zucco making such a sensible decision on the spot, and if Daniell had to make it, he would seem annoyed that there is yet another delay to his plans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, one trick used in all the Holmes series regarding the Professor is how to rid the film of him. If you read the Holmes stories, Moriarty appears as the villain three times: in THE MEMOIRS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES\&#39; last story (&#34;THE ADVENTURE OF THE FINAL PROBLEM&#34;), in THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES\&#39; first story (&#34;THE ADVENTURE OF THE EMPTY HOUSE&#34;) and the last of the four novels/novellas (THE VALLEY OF FEAR). It\&#39;s amazing how much mileage the Professor got out of so few appearances (he is mentioned in two or three other stories as well - in passing). But because of his fate at the Reichenbach Falls in &#34;THE FINAL PROBLEM&#34; and &#34;THE EMPTY HOUSE&#34;, we always see him fall to his death. Zucco falls off the White Tower on Tower Hill. Daniell (with more imagination) tries to flee Gregson and the police, but is shot as he jumps, and wounded fails to hold on to the wall of an adjacent building. Atwill (here it is not seen, but heard) seems to fall down a trap door he\&#39;s planted in an escape tunnel). It is really tedious after awhile to see the Professor always fall in these films. One turns to the Gene Wilder comedy (admittedly a comedy) SHERLOCK HOLMES\&#39; SMARTER BROTHER, wherein Leo McKern is a wonderfully wacky and villainous Moriarty (complete, finally, with an Irish accent), who is not killed at the end, but just left mulling - in a rowboat - over how his careful schemes did not work out. I rather liked that better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The use of the &#34;Dancing Men&#34; code here, like the use of the &#34;Devil\&#39;s Foot Root&#34; in DRESSED TO KILL, snags a part of a mystery from a short story. &#34;THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN&#34; appeared in THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, and deals with a client of Holmes whose wife has been getting weird, blood-curdling messages in this code. Charles Higham, in his biography THE ADVENTURES OF CONAN DOYLE suggests Sir Arthur may have picked up the code from a magazine game in the 1870s, but we really don\&#39;t know. The code is basically one of letter substitutions for the figures of the dancing men. The story in the short story is dramatic, but deals with a triangle. The only innovation in the film is that Tobel makes a slight change that confuses both Holmes and Moriarty. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film will entertain, but I still think THE HOUSE OF FEAR, THE SCARLET CLAW, and SHERLOCK HOLMES FACES DEATH are better films.&#39;
b&#34;I saw Two Hands back in Sydney a few years ago and it instantly became one of my all-time favourite films. It&#39;s got action, adventure, comedy and romance all rolled up into one (and a bit of zen thrown in for good measure). Like much Australian film, the plot is easy to follow yet wonderfully engaging, and Jordan should justly feel proud of his work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it was on TV just now on Channel 4 in London, and my two favourite comedy scenes of not just this movie, but indeed any movie, had been cut out! So if you watch this movie, make sure it&#39;s the original version.&#34;
b&#39;In this episode, a man and his dog go \&#39;coon huntin\&#39; after eating dinner with his wife of 50 years. He\&#39;s devoted to his wife and his dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While hunting, his dog jumps in the river after the dog and he follows. The man dies and doesn\&#39;t know it. He tries to talk to his wife and his grave diggers to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows is a tug of war between heaven and hell for the man\&#39;s soul and his dog helps make the decision. He\&#39;s being tricked by the devil and won\&#39;t go in to &#34;heaven&#34; unless his dog comes with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes you wonder if all the animal lovers have the right idea and want to go to heaven with them.&#39;
b&#34;This film is hard to knock. It follows in the tradition of Pulp Fiction, yet succeeds further by stamping its own unique style. The cast is awesome, the script is great - and things like the odd (Pulp Fiction-esque) time-sequencing is done brilliantly. I particularly like how the images provided in flash back vary dramatically depending on who is telling the story at the time. When it is one of the indoctrinated criminals everything is flashy and cool, but when it is the hero&#39;s recollection everything is skanky and disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an awesome film - and so I am extremely annoyed to find that I cant buy it anywhere!&#34;
b&#39;I found this movie on Netflix and had to add it to my queue. I wasn\&#39;t disappointed when I got it as it\&#39;s just as funny now as when I saw it at a local drive-in theater back then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It builds to a climax nicely with you getting glimpses of the various characters as they begin their trip across America on the &#34;Honky Tonk Freeway, America on wheels.&#34; This was a strange comedic role for William DeVane as I remember him as Kennedy in the 1974 TV film &#34;The Missiles of October&#34; and felt no one could have pulled that dramatic character off as well as he did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me a bit of Dick Van Dyke in &#34;Cold Turkey\&#39; where Van Dyke played the local minister. DeVane\&#39;s role as mayor, minister, and activist was typical for small towns so it makes his character seem amusing and real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Howard Hessman and Teri Garr as the spoiled family in the RV was on target for the time as well. Anyone who has traveled across country with small children, (Are we there yet?) will appreciate those scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scenes of a small town struggling to survive reminded me a lot of the small town I grew up in but they handled it with the charm and humor that you often only saw in small towns. It\&#39;s sad that many small towns disappeared because of the freeway system and it gives a realistic if humorous view of what they had to do to survive. (Used zoo animals anyone?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it\&#39;s a lightweight comedy with no particular message but a humorous glance at America during the early 80\&#39;s. Well worth watching if you just need a bit of good cheer.&#39;
b&#34;Michael Jackson is amazing. This short film displays the absolute highest standard in music video and no-one will ever be able to out-beat this &#39;King Of Pop&#39; masterpiece! It shows Michael turning into a zombie and dancing in the street with some spectacular choreography. The story is great, the scenes are marvelous, the music is fantastic and overall the clip is fun, eye-popping, spooky and is a real spectacle. Today everybody is still doing the same thing in music video with dancing and film-based story-lines which he innovated. This ground-breaking video is the toast of MTV and will forever be remembered for what is the greatest music video of all time!!&#34;
b&#34;Favela Rising is a documentary about the slums of Rio, the favelas, specifically the most violent one, Vig\xc3\xa1rio Geral. According to this film, a lot more kids have died violently in Rio&#39;s favelas over the last decade or so than in Israel/Palestine during the same period -- a fact astonishing if true, which shows how under-recognized this social problem is in the rest of the world. This is an important topic, especially for those who see hope in grassroots efforts to marshal the neediest and most at risk through a vibrant cultural program. This is a compelling documentary, if occasionally marred by a somewhat too personality-based version of events and by grainy digital video and film that sometimes may make you think you need to have your eyes examined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drug lords rule in the favelas and gun-toting teenage boys are the main drug dealers, like in parts of Colombia. Fernando Meirelles&#39; movie City of God/Cidade de Deus has been accused of celebrating violence (Cidade de Deus is another of Rio&#39;s many favelas). But the early section of Favela Rising shows that in fact favela boys do celebrate violence and want to deal drugs where the money and the action are. It&#39;s cool to carry a gun there, cool to work as a drug trafficker: it&#39;s fifty times more profitable than the earnings available by other means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mochary first discovered the AfroReggae movement and its leaders Anderson S\xc3\xa1 and Jos\xc3\xa9 Junior while visiting Rio for a conference and quickly persuaded his friend and mentor Zimbalist to quit his job and come down to help make a film with his own promise to fund it. S\xc3\xa1&#39;s eloquence and charisma and a startling twist in his life make him the center of the film and its chief narrator, but like the favelas themselves the film teems with other people. No doubt about the fact that S\xc3\xa1 is a remarkable leader, organizer, and artist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vig\xc3\xa1rio Geral is compared to Bosnia: shooting there was very dangerous. Anderson S\xc3\xa1&#39;s friendship and protection and caution and diplomacy in the shooting enabled the filmmakers to gain access and shoot detailed footage of their subject matters while (mostly: there were close calls) avoiding any serious confrontations with drug lords or drug-dealing cops. They also trained boys to use cameras and left them there on trips home. That resulted in 10% of the footage, including rare shots of violent incidents including police beatings. It&#39;s hard for an outsider to keep track of police massacres in Rio. There was one in the early 1990&#39;s that looms over the story and inspired S\xc3\xa1, who ended his own early involvement in drug trafficking to lead his cultural movement. The cops are all over the drug trade and if anybody doesn&#39;t like that the ill trained police paramilitaries come in (often wearing black ski masks) and shoot up a neighborhood, killing a lot of innocents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is pretty much the picture we get in Meirelles&#39; City of God, except that this time S\xc3\xa1, Junior, and the other guys come in, starting in Vig\xc3\xa1rio Geral but spreading out eventually to a number of other favelas to give percussion classes that attract dozens of youth -- girls as well as boys. Their AfroReggae (Grupo Cultural AfroReggae or GCAR) program, formed in 1993, is a new alternative way of life for young black men in the Rio ghettos. It leads them to leave behind smoking, alcohol, and drugs (that&#39;s the rule) to explode into rap, song, percussion, and gymnastics in expressive, galvanic performances. Eventually the best of the performers led by S\xc3\xa1 wind up appearing before big local audiences with local producers, and their Banda AfroReggae has an international recording contract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other centers and groups have been created by or through the GCAR over the years in Vig\xc3\xa1rio Geral and other favelas to seek the betterment of youth by providing training and staging performances of music, capoeira, theater, hiphop and dance at GCAR centers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performance arts aren&#39;t everything, just the focal point. GCAR is also a movement for broader social change Gathering public awareness through such performances, the centers also provide training in information (newspaper, radio, Internet, e-mail links), hygiene and sex education, to seek to bridge gaps between rich and poor, black and white, and to offer workshops in audio-visual work, including production of documentaries. The program is currently active in four other favelas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many scenes of favela street and home life in Favela Rising and they look very much like the images in City of God with the important difference that the focus and outcome are very, very much more positive. Not that it isn&#39;t an uphill battle. And the corruption of the police, the inequities of the social system, and the indifference of the general population of Brazil are not directly addressed by any of this. But there&#39;s a scene where S\xc3\xa1 talks to some young kids in another favela, cynical boys not enthusiastic about AfroReggae and determined to work in the drug trade as S\xc3\xa1 himself did as a boy. S\xc3\xa1 doesn&#39;t seem to be convincing any of them despite pointing out that traffickers don&#39;t make it to the age of fifty. But we learn that the most negative boy in this group, Richard Morales, joined the movement five months later. There&#39;s also the account of a freak accident that disabled S\xc3\xa1, but with a positive outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be great if the images were sharper and clearer and if the story were edited down a little, but this is vibrant, inspiring material and represents committed, risk-taking documentary film-making and it&#39;s nice that Favela Rising has been included in seven film festivals and won a number of awards, including Best New Documentary Filmmaker at the Tribeca Film Festival. It&#39;s currently being shown at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London. However, a wide art house audience in the US seems somewhat unlikely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included in the SFIFF 2006.&#34;
b&#39;great historical movie, will not allow a viewer to leave once you begin to watch. View is presented differently than displayed by most school books on this subject. My only fault for this movie is it was photographed in black and white; wished it had been in color ... wow !&#39;
b&#39;I got this movie with my BBC &#34;Jane Austen Collection&#34; (5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations) and didn\&#39;t like it at first. It\&#39;s completely different from the others and it lacks, or so I thought, one of the qualities that I enjoy in all other Austen movies: cheerful common sense. The nightmare scene in which Mrs. Richards apparently sews her fingers together was especially upsetting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still don\&#39;t like to watch the finger-sewing scene but I do love hearing Mrs. R. saying, dreamily, while she sews, &#34;My only acquaintance...tore my gown.&#34; This movie is now my current Austen favorite. I\&#39;ve watched it 7 or 8 times so far. The acting, to my mind, is incredible. The way I notice good acting is when I find myself looking up from whatever I\&#39;m doing (sewing, though not my fingers together, hopefully, or boondoggling or whatever) in order to watch the character deliver his lines. It\&#39;s the turn of expression, the cast of posture, that make the words come alive -- that\&#39;s what makes good acting, as far as I\&#39;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I watch almost every part of &#34;Northanger Abbey&#34; because almost all the actors play their roles with such charisma. Peter Firth is amazing as Mr. Tilney, the perfect blend of Bathian fop and real, masculine hero - you\&#39;re not sure until the end whether he\&#39;s after Catherine\&#39;s money or not. I love his touch of (Welsh?) accent. Mr. and Mrs. Richards are charming: the combination of their behaviors - especially Mr. Richards\&#39; high voice, lending counterpoint to his wit and wisdom - makes them so real. General Tilney as the hard-hearted father who may possibly be a murderer is fascinating, too. And Captain Tilney, the grinning rake who is so clearly enjoying himself... and the moneygrubbing sister and brother whose names I can\&#39;t currently remember - the two of them are so perfectly, at once, smart and smarmy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reason I love this adaptation is that it is the most romantic of all the Jane Austen adaptations. I know this was one of Austen\&#39;s weak points (well, it is as far as I am concerned): even though all her novels are love stories, it\&#39;s hard to feel that her heroes and heroines are really in love at the end. And if they\&#39;re aren\&#39;t really in love, then what\&#39;s the point? All the other adaptations I\&#39;ve seen (other than the early Olivier/Garson one) have pretty cold-fish kisses at the end, if they kiss at all. I don\&#39;t at all like sex in movies but it really is necessary to have a heartfelt kiss in the end. And the ending kiss in Northanger is a doozy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The over-the-top approach to costumes, music, and lighting work very well as far as I\&#39;m concerned. And the script is extremely clever - the way we are educated about Gothic romance, highlife in Bath, Cathy\&#39;s normal country upbringing, etc., is very well done, as they usually are in BBC productions. Also, I like the part when the little black page does the cartwheels. And the Marchionesse, I think, was an entirely appropriate and very clever expository device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have objected that this version is the opposite of what Jane Austen intended to do in Northanger Abbey - she meant to make fun of Gothic romance, not promote it. But I don\&#39;t think she meant to put &#34;Mysteries of Udolpho,&#34; etc., down. She was just making the point that you need to distinguish between reality and fiction. And this point is made when Mr. Tilney chides Catherine in his mother\&#39;s room. Besides, General Tilney was a villain, albeit a prosaic one. That point was meant to be made, surely.&#39;
b&#34;When I stepped into the theater, I thought this was going to be a great movie. And I was not disappointed one bit. WOW! This movie is brilliant! The emotions felt through out the whole movie are extraordinary! Great acting by Madhavan and Simran. Beautiful music by A.R. Rahman. This might most probably be the best Tamil movie I&#39;ve seen in ages. Mani Ratnam has yet again proved that he is the best in making meaningful and heartfelt movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is basically about a young girl (P.S. Keerthana) who is in search of her biological mother (Nandita Das) who abandoned her in a refugee camp to fight for her country just like her husband (J.D. Chakravathy). A young novelist (Madhavan) finds out about this young girl&#39;s story and decides to write a story about her. He and his wife (Simran) decide to adopt this young child but one day she finds out that they are not her real parents and decides to search for her biological mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie really screams EXCELLENT. The way Mani Ratnam presented the movie is magnificent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Rating - 10/10&#34;
b&#39;You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it. The film opens with images of planes landing at an airport, one plane after another diving into a mirage-filled runway. You will be able to accurately guess that this movie is not about a &#34;story.&#34; At first viewing, it\&#39;s even easy to think the opening images are repetitive shots of the same plane. The initial drama is in the acuteness of your perception, which is built on your willingness to experience the film simply as a series of images. If after this opening, you want to see the movie, you will not be bored. You may even be mesmerized. The movie may be an emotional experience; it may be an intellectual experience; it may be both. Judging from the DVD commentary, which is essential, it was primarily an emotional experience for Herzog, and, at one point, he talks explicitly about how the film is a collaboration between filmmaker and viewer. There\&#39;s plenty of room for the viewer to make of this film exactly what he or she wants to make of it. Take a gamble?&#39;
b&#34;&#39;Don&#39;t Look In the Basement&#39; is so easy to knock but the truth is simply that Brownrigg is one of Horrors real underground stars and IMHO is vastly overdue some proper recognition. &#39;Don&#39;t&#39; is his undisputed masterpiece. This scummy psychodrama snags the viewer straightaway into such an odd, disjointed, claustrophobic world of sweating insanity you have no real idea what the hell is going on. It succeeds in making you feel strangely dirty, just plain grubby, for Brownrigg&#39;s world is this mad, unwashed, scummy prison cell of rants, obsessions and all shades of mental illness. And he uses his low budget palette to wrap his grot blanket around you like a bad memory. There is just something so beautifully odd about the whole damn thing. In a word, classic.... Also, if you watch &#39;Don&#39;t&#39; first then you will have some idea of the insane psychodrama style that marks Brownrigg&#39;s other films. In summary they really don&#39;t come any more esoteric than this - well, actually they do, track down Brownrigg&#39;s &#39;Keep My Grave Open&#39;. Mad genius. Accept no substitute.&#34;
b&#39;No music. No stupid masala. A reasonably realistic portrayal of the police system in India and based on a real &#34;encounter&#34; specialist in India, Daya Nayak. That is Ab Tak 56 (56 symbolises how many criminals the lead &#34;Sadhu Agashe&#34; has killed&#34; - well you already know that bit)Brilliance exudes Nan Patekar in the role as a relaxed and calculating Indian cop. THe one liners are just hilarious. The plot though slightly predictable on review, is intriguing all the same. Another one of the films from Ram Gopal Vermas The Factory. Movies which are either decent or really good, Ab Tak CHappan meanders close to very good. But yet remains one of the Top 70 films released from India, commercial and artsy included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is great is the story telling is relaxed and showcases finally (in an Indian flick) how the police network works. The cast is really damn good but seriously the one liners are funny as hell (though i dont know if the subtitled version will appear as funny) The producers are trying for a Cannes release, which is interesting. Made by debut director Shamit Aman (i think thats his name).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again 55 y.o. Nana Patekar is brilliant away from his silly shouting roles of the past, just shows what a good director can do with a good actor. Really good stuff. If you are interested in Indian movies and are disgusted by the nonsense some of our guys dish out then this is definitely a relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again Patekar is the guy who happilly carries the movie on his shoulders and epitomises the style of the movie- relaxed, funny, intelligent and calculating. Good dialoges, good acting, nice direction all in all Great stuff. Recommendations: Gangaajal, Ram Gopal Verma\&#39;s Company (both Indian flicks)&#39;
b&#39;The 80\&#39;s is largely considered the decade in which horror decided to have fun. Sometimes, there were some definite brains behind it all (&#34;Evil Dead II&#34;, &#34;Night of the Creeps&#34; and &#34;Return of the Living Dead&#34; for example) and then there were those movies that were mindless but had a definite low rent charm and were perfect for a night with beer and friends. Movies like &#34;Pieces&#34; and &#34;Blood Diner&#34; stacked rental shelves in the 80\&#39;s and 90\&#39;s, offering little in intelligence or craftsmanship but plenty in dumb entertainment. Kevin Tenney\&#39;s 1988 movie &#34;Night of the Demons&#34; is a part of this tradition-stupid, poorly acted and not an original bone in it\&#39;s body, but dammit if you don\&#39;t have a good time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is so simplistic it just had to come from the 80\&#39;s: a group of dumb teens played by a bunch of actors in their mid to late 20\&#39;s decide to go to a party at Hull House thrown by Angela (Mimi Kinkade) and Suzanne (Scream Queen legend Linnea Quigley.) Well, Angela and co. decide to throw a s\xc3\xa9ance. This turns out to be as Will Arnett\&#39;s &#34;Arrested Development&#34; character Gob would call it, a &#34;Huge Mistake,&#34; because a demonic force soon possesses Angela, and starts to get to the others as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take &#34;The Evil Dead&#34;, &#34;A Nightmare on Elm Street&#34; and your average dumb dead teen flick, throw them in a blender, and &#34;Night of the Demons&#34; is what you get. The movie is anything but original, and really, it\&#39;s not a good movie. The whole thing is insanely derivative, the acting is terrible, the jokes often fall flat, the characters are annoying (especially the character of Stooge) and the plot holes are numerous. That out of the way, it\&#39;s still a lot of fun. So why? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well for one thing, the make up and gore effects are top notch, with some really memorable moments (especially a nasty and just plane odd bit with a tube of lipstick) that really stick out. It also rarely if ever takes itself too seriously, yet with the exception of some terrible puns, plays it straight and never wastes the audiences time with winking self awareness. Plus, there\&#39;s a definite energy and enthusiasm to the whole enterprise that\&#39;s almost impossible to resist. Yeah, it\&#39;s nothing special, but it knows that, and it couldn\&#39;t be more proud of that fact. It\&#39;s a goofy party horror movie, and it never pretends to be anything more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might not be a classic, but &#34;Night of the Demons&#34; is a good example of horror junk food done right. It might not be too memorable or original, but sometimes you don\&#39;t want a fancy beer. Sometimes you want a Budweiser.&#39;
b&#34;This movie is simply awesome. It is so hilarious. Although the skating and other montages are played out, the comedy is awesome. Raab Himself and Brandon Dicamillo are hilarious. There will be moments when you can&#39;t breath you&#39;re laughing so hard. Plus, there are scenes that you can watch hundreds of times and still laugh. This is one of the funniest comedies I&#39;ve ever seen.&#34;
b&#34;Not high art, not even exceptionally innovative, but a thoroughly enjoyable movie. Funny, fresh, intelligent - there are still people out there who don&#39;t need millions of dollars to hide that they&#39;re out of ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you compare this to your average Hollywood action flick, you&#39;re comparing a homemade meal with a big mac.&#34;
b&#34;If you want to have a great time then this is THE movie to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the premise - There is this college which admits people with minimum qualifications of BA, B.Com, M.Com, MA, MBA, MCA, B.E., M.Tech and BCA. So you have to take into account the time consumed and thus it is obvious that all students are 40+ Also the school admits students of a &#39;heavier&#39; dispensation and has a course of P.Hd in weight loss and the only student who failed this course is Manisha Koirala. Only she was a snake in the past life. Still not convinced? OK read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#39;s a scene. Akshay Kumar, a college student, is chased by Arman and he takes out a bazooka and shoots him! Then throws grenades. Then one of the grenades hits Akshay. But doesn&#39;t die and continues to fight, Arman, the snake, plunges a half foot dagger into Akshay and stomps on it but Akshay is still there. Then Akshay gets on a jet ski and follows Arman. They fight and Arman chokes Akshay underwater and finally Akshay is dead. So we think, as soon as Arman is out of the picture Akshay swims away to Raj Babbar, Principal of this college + Boxing Refree + Parapsychology ka professor + mumbling priest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But no one, I repeat no one takes the cake but a certain Mr. Nigam. You gotto watch to learn more. :-)&#34;
b&#39;&#34;Summer of My German Soldier&#34; was one of the many TV movies that became a staple of the small screen in the 1970s (others were &#34;Brian\&#39;s Song&#34;, &#34;Sybil&#34; and &#34;Someone\&#39;s Watching Me!&#34;). It portrays a Jewish girl (Kristy McNichol) befriending a German POW (Bruce Davison) in WWII-era Georgia. One of the things that the movie shows is that many of the German soldiers weren\&#39;t really Nazis, but were just drafted. Watching the movie, I got a real sense of how things must have been in the South back then; I mean, can you imagine being a Jewish person accused of supporting the enemy? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I certainly recommend this movie. I believe that it\&#39;s always important to show the things portrayed here. Occasional overacting keeps the movie from being a full-scale masterpiece, but they usually do quite well. I hope that the movie eventually comes out on DVD. Also starring Esther Rolle and Michael Constantine (the &#34;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&#34; patriarch).&#39;
b&#34;I watched this movie with my mother. She is 81 yrs.old and was raised to be a bigot. She even acknowledges this. I don&#39;t think she really understood what was happening, she had already made up her mind that the kid was guilty. Scary. I felt for this child and his family. What torture they went through and remained faithful. That is true faith. Back to the movie. I was disgusted by the police force and their ineptitude. I am so glad that this public defender was chosen to work this case. It was very fortunate for this family that they had a person that cared enough to see through the crap that was handed to him. I could tell when one the cops was lying. He would not look the defender in the eyes. His eyes moved to the side when he answered the questions. It is unfortunate that a black person has to be punished because of the color of his skin. I read the book about the black man being dragged behind a truck by three white men. They were finally found guilty after many years. I can&#39;t remember the title, but it was the same premise. Whites doing whatever they want with blacks. I am sure the child in the movie will be traumatized for a long time, if not forever. I pointed out to my mother that most serial killers and pedophiles are white. No comment from her. I want to commend the director and producer of this film. I feel the exposure they gave to this blatant injustice was a necessary project. I am an avid viewer of indy films. I feel that they are well written and have substance. I am pleased that I happened to grab this movie on the shelf. I felt compelled to write a comment because of how strongly I feel about the film and the prejudice that continues to exist in our modern society.&#34;
b&#34;Saw the film at the Hollywood Film Festival in Oct &#39;04 . Mark Robertson took a huge chance writing an extremely difficult part for his first film and it paid off big in his casting of Kelly Overton. I had a strong feeling she came from the theater so I looked her up here and ...surprise, I&#39;m right. More Hollywood actors should follow her lead, give up the expensive acting classes and get back to theater because only with that kind of training will you be prepared for a ride like this. For all the great things I can say about the film and the director (and there are many) I just can&#39;t stop talking to people about Kelly Overton&#39;s masterful performance. We&#39;ll be seeing a LOT MORE of her work, no doubt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations to Mark and Kelly on a daring film. Get it out in the theaters so I can bring all the people I made want to see the film ASAP!&#34;
b&#34;This movie was good. I can&#39;t say it was one of the best, but it still was good. The only reason that I watched it was because of Ryan Phillippe. He is soo hot! (Don&#39;t get mad Reese). But I think that it was sort of funny- not a laugh your head out kinda thing, but still O.K.&#34;
b&#34;I am very impressed with the acting in Comanche Moon. Before I started watching this, I wasn&#39;t expecting it to be as good as Lonesome Dove. I couldn&#39;t believe how well the actors were chosen to represent all the characters. It blew my mind how well they played each role! This was in my opinion almost as good as Lonesome Dove. Its hard to compare any film to Lonesome Dove. If you don&#39;t make that comparison, I would give this a thumbs up. It was very entertaining! I don&#39;t post many comments on this site, but I just felt I had to get my opinion out there. Amazing! I don&#39;t want to go off naming every actor who was brilliant, because I would probably have to list every single one. My favorite was Steve Zahn. He hit the nail on the head playing Captain Gus. His mannerisms were perfect.&#34;
b&#34;Throw Momma hasn&#39;t dated at all, it&#39;s as funny now as when it was released. A genuinely eccentric comedy, that doesn&#39;t try too hard to be liked and is all the better for it, full of memorable laugh out loud lines. Even small characters are well written and beautifully played, like Billy Crystal&#39;s best friend&#39;s girlfriend, and a lovely cameo from Rob Reiner as Crystal&#39;s agent. A little bit insane and a lot funny.&#34;
b&#39;I watched this show until my puberty but still I found it to reflex many situations that worry us when we\&#39;re teenagers although it was a family oriented show. Until the mid 90\&#39;s it focused more on the young adults and their situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That\&#39;s why I loved &#34;Step By Step&#34;. I mean, it offered situations for every age and unlike many shows of it\&#39;s kind, it delivered expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let\&#39;s be honest; this wasn\&#39;t an extremely funny show, no, but it had some situations that you could feel related to but only funnier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was an extremely good charm between Patrick Duffy and Susan Sommers. Duffy rocked! Sommers was tender and actually funny. I was in love with Stacy Keegan because she was extremely sexy (loved her legs) and witty. But Sasha Mitchell stole the show with his Cody character. He was the man back in the day! Oh, the memories. Nowadays, this show wasn\&#39;t been able to adequate correctly on the new generations and that\&#39;s why it should be kept in the vault of memories. That\&#39;s it, only memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Step By Step for making my puberty funnier.&#39;
b&#34;This was truly a tense and dark episode. Excellently executed, wonderful acting and atmospheric directing, &#39;Ice&#39; is one of my favorite episodes. Along with &#39;Pusher&#39; &#39;Grotesque&#39; &#39;Wetwired&#39; and &#39;Home&#39; (these are quite good in dark atmosphere in my case) It seem quite realistic to me, their paranoia, their suspicion and their ever growing rage was perfectly executed by the great actors. However, &#39;Ice&#39; had a problem that I got over after a few watches: IT WAS TOO SHORT! I WANTED MORE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, &#39;ice&#39; had what 98% of all X Files episodes have: Excellent acting, Intense story-writing, gritty directing. All the works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 out of 10&#34;
b&#34;If you&#39;ve been looking for a film where a out of control nympho gets chained to a radiator by an extremely religious southern man then look no further than Paramount Vantage&#39;s latest release &#39;Black Snake Moan&#39;. Not exactly looking for what I just described you say? Well then, you best get ya wits &#39;bout yaself and mosey on down to your local theater and still see it as Samuel L. Jackson&#39;s character Lazarus would say. As long as you&#39;re open minded and don&#39;t take everything seriously, there&#39;s no reason you won&#39;t leave the theater glad you saw it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the third offering from director Craig Brewer, we are taken into the deep south where as the tagline to the film claims, everything is hotter. While there we&#39;re introduced to the Godfearing bluesman, Lazarus as previously said played by Jackson, and the almost always half naked Rae; a role bravely taken on by Christina Ricci. In the film this unlikely pair cross paths long enough for their characters to each learn a lesson from one another. Both lessons ultimately convey the message to us the audience that no matter what, we are all human. No one is perfect and if everyone would realize that, then we&#39;d be a lot better off. The question of if this will be understood, or be accepted by all who see the film is another story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing not up for debate is how great Jackson and Ricci both are here. You&#39;d think with the role of a sex-crazed woman, overacting would be a given, but no, not here. Ricci breaks through and demonstrates true talent with a raw performance that also doubles as her best to date. Then we have Jackson who completely disappears and for the first time in a long time makes us forget who he even is. Sadly, the third star of the film, Justin Timberlake who plays Rae&#39;s military-bound boyfriend isn&#39;t all that great. At the start, he fails miserably as he appears to be trying too hard. Later on he steps it up some, still he&#39;s far from the level he reached in January&#39;s &#39;Alpha Dog&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing &#39;Black Snake Moan&#39; boasts is a splendid soundtrack. Containing tracks from The Black Keys, John Doe, pieces from the score done by Scott Bomar, &amp; of course four, count &#39;em, four tracks from Jackson himself. It&#39;s actually one of his songs, the main performance of the film, &#39;Stackolee&#39; that is the fuel to the fire of this great collection. It alone is worth the ticket price. Other notable musical delights from the soundtrack are Bomar&#39;s &#39;The Chain&#39;, &#39;When the Lights Go Out&#39; from the Black Keys, &amp; the title track which is also among the most memorable scenes in the film where Lazarus sings to Rae on a stormy night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The efforts of Craig Brewer can&#39;t go without mention though. His last film &#39;Hustle &amp; Flow&#39; which ended up surpassing low expectations and gaining critical acclaim put him on the map. What he has done with &#39;Black Snake Moan&#39; will be what sets him apart from other newbies to the industry. He not only directed &#39;Moan&#39;, but also wrote its screenplay. The end result is a story that is surprising and clever. As you watch you feel like you know exactly where it&#39;s headed despite its valiant composure. Just as you think you&#39;ve predicted the next move Brewer shifts gears and takes an entirely different route. There are however some blotches within the screenplay. The background characters are drab and flat while the ending is somewhat disappointing. It left me craving for something more exciting. After so many highs I guess the final scenes were a tad weak compared to the rest of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine the majority of people who see &#39;Black Snake Moan&#39; won&#39;t enjoy it due to the fact they won&#39;t be able to stop themselves from thinking how unlikely the situations are. The depressing part about that is there are many other films with just as unlikely, even more outrageous scenarios that are widely well received. It&#39;s the issues of race, religious motives, &amp; sexuality the film exhibits that will have more effect on opinion than anything. The idea of a black man chaining a white woman up in his house is enough to make most people not even consider seeing it. Simply put, it&#39;s not for everyone. Like I said, to fully enjoy it you have to go in with an open mind, or else you&#39;re just wasting your money. For those of you who can do that, I highly recommend it.&#34;
b&#39;With all of mainland Europe under his control Hitler prepares for the last obstacle in his way before heading for North America, Great Britain. With an overwhelming edge in aircraft Goering\&#39;s Luftwaffe looks unstoppable on paper. Once in the air however the RAF tenaciously disrupts the paradigm by blowing the enemy out of sky air at a seven to one rate. The Battle of Britain rages on for a over a year as the Island nation is bloodied but unbowed providing crucial time for their American allies to produce more arms for the inevitable struggle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using more staged footage than the three previous documentaries in the Why We Fight series the Battle of Britain has a more propaganda like feel to it with the dramatized (some with unmistakable Warners music score ) scenes glaringly obvious to newsreel. In an ironic twist amid the devastation caused by German air attacks Beethoven\&#39;s Seventh Symphony is employed to underscore the visual suffering. The story itself is one of remarkable courage by a defiant nation who refused to buckle under to the devastating attacks inflicted upon it by up until that point an invincible war machine. It is the 20th century version of the 300 Spartans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been more exhaustively researched and better looking commercial efforts done on this battle since this film but the immediacy and motivation The Battle of Britain provided then will always make it a more valuable document of England during its &#34;Finest Hour&#34;.&#39;
b&#34;Series as a whole - Jim Henson&#39;s best work. John Hurt *is* the Storyteller. Often Oscar-caliber screenplays, not surprising when you consider Minghella doing the writing. Oscar-caliber acting, always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sapsorrow - Everybody loves &#39;The Soldier and Death,&#39; but something about &#39;Sapsorrow&#39; pushes it an iota higher in my favor. In the first ballroom scene, the costumes, the music - perfection. Hurt and the dog typically semi-interact with the story, but this time Minghella pushes it up that extra notch in the &#39;ring&#39; scene between Hurt and Sapsorrow. The chemistry between characters is especially well-developed, more so than usual in the series, in reference to the friendship between Straggletag and the prince. Seen it? See it again. Pay more attention (to those of you who don&#39;t fanatically adore this 22-minute piece of cinematic perfection). Never seen it? I am so, so sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luck Child - not as sophisticated as Sapsorrow, but very clever in its own right. This is a story about irony. Irony upon irony, within irony... I love it. Every character is acted to perfection, with the exception of the ferryman. He was doing drama; everyone else was doing romantic comedy. I forgive him. This is my favorite of the primarily comedic episodes, &#39;Sapsorrow&#39; and &#39;The Soldier and Death&#39; being examples of more dramatic episodes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: Greek Myths. What it lack in Minghella subtlety (different writer) it partially makes up for in boldness as it portrays the four chosen myths with more sympathy and respect and history than is usual. Also check out the Jim Henson Hour if you can get your hands on it. For Storyteller adicts, it features The Man Himself introducing the myths, the lion from &#39;True Bride,&#39; and... No Annoying Opening Theme! Half Storyteller, half pure, unadulterated muppet wit.&#34;
b&#34;Surface is one of the best shows that I have ever seen. NBC is so stupid for canceling a great show like this and worse of all only leaving it half complete. NBC or someone else should give Surface at least one more season just so it can be completed. It&#39;s as if NBC gave you a book to read and half way through it they decide to take it away from you and then you can never find out the ending. I just want to see what happens to everyone and most importantly see what happens to Nim. I think I can say this safely about most Surface fans is that we want to save Nim! Nim has taken all of our hearts away and then NBC just cuts them in two. Come on NBC, just give Surface one more season!&#34;
b&#39;IMDb forces reviewers to type a certain amount of lines, but all I really want to say is -- &#34;This is an incredible film, and you can\&#39;t consider yourself a film fan without having seen it.&#34; You ought to just trust me on this one and stop reading this review and get the movie and push play. But I have to type something. So, let me point out the following: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) River\&#39;s Edge contains what still may well rank as Crispin Glover\&#39;s all-time funniest and best performance in a film, and if you have been following Crispin Glover at all, you know that that alone justifies giving it a 10. Funny lines galore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) River\&#39;s Edge contains the second-most memorable performance of Dennis Hopper\&#39;s career (other than the one in Blue Velvet), and it is really excellent. Dennis Hopper is really funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) River\&#39;s Edge contains the best performance of Keanu Reeves\&#39; career, and it is excellent. It was the role he was born to play. He has plenty of good lines, but one in particular is really really funny. Listen close when his character and the step-dad are talking to one another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still the best stoner film, it is much more than just that. It tends to show up in the drama sections of film-rental stores, but if this is a drama, it\&#39;s the funniest drama of all time.&#39;
b&#39;I\&#39;m not sure what I can add that hasn\&#39;t already been said in some of these other fine, and quite hilarious, comments, but Ill try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you know the plot: there is a bed possessed by a demon that &#34;absorbs&#34; and selectively disintegrates the bodies of whoever (or whatever) lays on it with its orange soda-filled body. We have the man, in some scenes looking uncannily like Robert Smith of The Cure, hanging out inside the wall commenting on the goings-on, and we have our various victims that just cant resist the comfort of this mystical bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is no ordinary bed. No sirree Bob! Not only does it eat people, but it cleans up after itself, draws the covers back, and it even makes itself. Who wouldn\&#39;t want a bed like that? It can even use its sheets as a rudimentary &#34;lasso&#34; to wrangle escaped victims back in (especially if they\&#39;re taking up half the length of the film to try and escape).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our &#34;main&#34; story (if you can call it that), is about these three girls who go out to this remote area to house-sit(??). I don\&#39;t recall exactly, but it doesn\&#39;t really matter though as there are plenty of things that defy convention that you just have to give in and accept. The dialogue in the film is like no other; the characters talk to each other seemingly by telepathy as their mouths never seem to move and there is a constant echo. One of our girls believes she isn\&#39;t liked by the rest of &#34;the gang&#34; and makes sure to tell us all her feelings on this matter through an echoey voice-over, but we don\&#39;t care; character development was thrown out the window a LONG time before in this film so why start now? There are scenes when the bed laughs, snores, crunches, and makes various other noises that we assume judging by our cast\&#39;s non-reaction to said noises, cant be heard. This and the telepathy makes the issue of diegesis very difficult to ascertain...but thats OK....this is Death Bed: The Bed That Eats and it defies all logic so its OK. It makes for a lush dreamy quality to this most bizarre film If you buy (hehe buy...did I say &#34;buy&#34;?) this DVD, make sure to check out the introduction by the director. He explains that the filming of this &#34;flick&#34; started in 1972, didn\&#39;t wrap up until 1977, he shopped it for a few years with no luck, and then fast forward 26 years to 2003 it gets released on DVD. Supposedly someone somewhere had a print of this in some other country and made bootleg after bootleg of it and it was quite by chance, on a message board no less, that our director found evidence that people knew, and gasp! cared, about his little-known film. Its from there that he decided to give it a shot and release it. I\&#39;m glad he did. Once you\&#39;ve even so much as heard the title to this film, you MUST see it. I for one am going to buy this and I\&#39;m going to preach its gospel around the world...starting with this comment&#39;
b&#39;Music videos are often completely disregarded in any discussion about film, with most people considering them to be a lesser art form. While a great majority are merely flashy clips to advertise a popular performer\&#39;s latest hit single, a precious few really do rise above the rest, becoming works of art in their own right {anything directed by Spike Jonze or Michel Gondry is always worth watching}. While &#34;art&#34; isn\&#39;t precisely the word I\&#39;d use to describe Michael Jackson\&#39;s \&#39;Thriller (1983),\&#39; it is an intensely-likable hybrid of schlock horror and music, and an outrageously-campy short film that remains remarkably endearing nearly 25 years later. The thirteen-minute music video, both the longest and most expensive ever at the time of its release, was directed by John Landis, a filmmaker I\&#39;m not terribly familiar with, though \&#39;The Blues Brothers (1980)\&#39; is a classic, and I hear that \&#39;An American Werewolf in London (1981)\&#39; is a stupendously entertaining horror/comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether or not \&#39;Thriller\&#39; actually qualifies as a music video is certainly up for debate, taking into account its extensive length {though Jackson bettered this effort with 1997\&#39;s \&#39;Ghosts,\&#39; at 38 minutes} and the fact that the title song comprises less than half of the total running time. The video opens with a brief film-within-a-film, as Michael, on a quiet and brightly-lit night, reveals to his girlfriend (Ola Ray) that he is &#34;different&#34; from other guys, transforming into a hideous werewolf as the nighttime clouds part to reveal a full moon. As he presumably decapitates the unfortunate heroine, we come across Michael and his girl in the movie theatre, actually watching this drama unfold in a horror picture. When the girl becomes frightened, they both leave cinema and begin to walk home, at which point Michael begins to sing the opening lines of his latest song, &#34;Thriller.&#34; However, when a hoard of blood-thirsty zombies emerge from the local graveyard {their entrance ghoulishly narrated by Vincent Price}, the situation begins to get interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s difficult to quite put my finger on why \&#39;Thriller\&#39; is considered one of the greatest of all music videos. It can\&#39;t simply be that the song itself is a lot of fun, and Michael Jackson \xc2\x96 though he has since become the butt of all comedians\&#39; jokes for his peculiar personality and doings \xc2\x96 there\&#39;s no doubt that he is an excellent singer and performer. Perhaps a decent explanation for the film\&#39;s popularity is the incredible amount of work that must have gone into it; nothing like it had ever been seen before, and it still remains something of an oddity in the world of music videos. The gruesome monster make-up effects were engineered by Rick Baker, and are surprisingly graphic for a music clip, though it\&#39;s all carried out with a good sense of fun. Several moments make for some genuinely exciting suspense, successfully capturing the atmosphere of the films which it is parodying {though always with a cheesy twist on the usual formula}. Simply put, you\&#39;ll never look at a zombie movie in the same way again!&#39;
b&#34;Four stories about the drug trade in Europe become intertwined over the course of this 6 part miniseries. In Germany a businessman is arrested on drug smuggling charges, and his wife attempts to save her family by continuing her husband&#39;s illegal trade. Meanwhile the British Home Secretary travels to Pakistan to negotiate an aid package that he hopes will stop the drug flow from that country. Even as he does this however his own daughter succumbs to heroin addiction, tearing their family apart. This is the miniseries on which the American film and miniseries were based. The original is far superior to its two decendants. The poverty and desperation of the third world are portrayed very well. It is stark, uncompromising and brutal.&#34;
b&#39;This film marked the end of the &#34;serious&#34; Universal Monsters era (Abbott and Costello meet up with the monsters later in &#34;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankentstein&#34;). It was a somewhat desparate, yet fun attempt to revive the classic monsters of the Wolf Man, Frankenstein\&#39;s monster, and Dracula one &#34;last&#34; time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say desparate, because in the previous film, &#34;House of Frankenstein,&#34; both Dracula and the Wolf Man are killed according to how the vampire and werewolf legends say they should be (Dracula by the sunlight, and the wolf man by a silver bullet). Yet somehow they return in House of Dracula with no explanation. This movie could have played as a kind of prequel to House of Frankenstein if the Frankenstein monster plot wouldn\&#39;t be continuing chronologically into House of Dracula from House of Frankenstein, and if the wolf man didn\&#39;t get cured. Then there\&#39;d be no plot holes. But since this is not the case, the plots of Dracula and the Wolf Man make no sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, ignoring these plot holes, House of Dracula is a classic atmospheric horror film that\&#39;s fun to watch. It has many high points. Especially seeing the wolf man get cured. I know I just said that this shouldn\&#39;t have been included, but it was nice to actually see him get cured after all this time. And the scene with the lady playing &#34;Moonlight Senada,&#34; on the piano then all of a sudden playing a haunting melody when under Dracula\&#39;s spell was very eerie. Dr. Edleman\&#39;s transformation into the &#34;Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde&#34; type character was also done very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it\&#39;s great to see Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Wolf Man together, one &#34;last&#34; time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** out of ****&#39;
b&#34;I like the earlier description of this movie as a life poem. I caught this totally at random on the Movie Channel last night, and was captivated enough to stick with it the whole way. There&#39;s really just a toally unique voice to the film, a poetry of narration that&#39;s meaningful without straying into pretension. There&#39;s also many hilarious moments from Wirey&#39;s middle-school days that are crude without being potty humor. It&#39;s sad that this movie is so low-rated. The fact that there are so many 1&#39;s makes me think the numbers are cooked- I can&#39;t see how anyone could see the movie as that abysmal. Sure, this is by no means a typical romantic comedy, but it is a very unique viewpoint of a very unique life, of a man whose very appeal comes from his detachment, a detachment he must overcome before it destroys him. Give this flick a chance. It came out of nowhere for me, and I feel the richer for it.&#34;
b&#34;i first saw this short when i bought a random DVD of short films a while ago. this is the only short on the DVD i liked, but i don&#39;t just like it i love it... if you spend any amount of time with me, you will see it. it is beautiful, simple and passionate, no bells, no whistles - it could have been done with a sharpie (but don&#39;t get me wrong, the animation is elegant and insightful - this person clearly spent plenty of time with cats - but it is simply black and white) and then there is writing and the music... it is simply beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i eat chocolate, drink wine and watch it over and over again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nothing else matters, i wait for Pedro Serrazina to come up with something else.&#34;
b&#34;Good animation, nice character design, and a light-hearted story make Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu enjoyable to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first viewing, I thought that this anime was pretty good, but but was much better on for a second watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is because it is done out of chronological order, and once you re watch it in correct order you notice connections you didn&#39;t see before. (OR it may be that you see a second meaning to some events you didn&#39;t notice before) You may want to read the original novels (not manga) by Tanigawa Nagaru before/after seeing this. The anime is very good at visualizing every detail in the stories it shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are some short stories from the book that are not animated, but are referenced to.(bamboo w/ wishes attached shown in episode 14) Overall, this anime is actually very good once after brief analyzation of the plot (reading the book improves upon it as well). It is a nice break from the shounen-jump anime that seem to be taking over.&#34;
b&#34;MPAA Rating PG-13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Rating: 10 and up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My * Rating 9.5/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William H. Macy delivers a stunning performance as the role of Mr. Neuman. He makes you feel sympathetic and scared for him simultaniously. The story starts out as a comedy and slowly but steadily becomes almost like a horror film with twists and turns that Macy effortly masters. I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off this film even after it ended, and I couldn&#39;t beleive it ended when it did. A MUST TO SEE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE CONSIDERED A SPOILER BY SOME&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you watch the film, look at the plot this way: The Neumans are the United States as a whole, and the charactor Meat Loaf Aday plays is the people in the United States who are anti-Semetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a very enjoyable film and would reccomend to anyone I saw in the street.&#34;
b&#39;Some films are designed to just entertain you, others to make you laugh, or cry, or uplift, others, like this, aim to provoke, to make you think, and to make you angry. I was angry during this film, not at the film, but at the fact that it was true, that America, the free, does torture in the illogical view that it is doing it for the greater good. The torture scenes in this movie were harrowing, the indifference of people was shattering, the film was compelling in its argument, and showed just how wrong it is to torture people. Of course now that makes me a &#34;bleeding liberal&#34; labels shoved on people by others who shut their minds to the facts that this does happen and should not. People who don\&#39;t realise that as the movie said, for every person tortured,you get ten or one hundred people rise up to perform acts of vengeance. You get an ever increasing cycle of violence. This film did not make me hate America, although I can see how it could do, but it made me hate the way that America has reacted in its post 9/11 world. There is a significant quote in the film, just after we have learned that 19 people have died and seventy five were injured in the bomb scene, the quote is &#34;one American is dead&#34; - that makes the difference. You cannot kill an American, America can kill thousands but you cannot kill a single American, or they will do whatever it takes, including torture to enact justice. This is the American way apparently. Call me a liberal, call me naive (although I think the people who think torture is fine are naive) call me deluded, call me anything you like, but this film is a brilliant example of what is wrong in America and the west today. I wish this film would be shown to all school students, at a minimum. This film will stay with me a long time, part of me wishes I could forget it, because I wish this type of thing never happened, but I know it does, the other part of me wishes I would never forget, because we need to remember these shameful events to prevent them from happening again. Whatever happens to me, this film will be with me for a long time, and I will be telling everyone I know to watch it, not to be entertained, but to be provoked, because sometimes we all need to be provoked.&#39;
b&#34;Rowan Atkinson&#39;s creation Mr.Bean has stood the test of time and will be forever etched upon the memory of those who viewed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living alone and appearing not to have a job of any description Mr.Bean goes around doing day to day activities in a rather comedic fashion.The mistake prone Mr.Bean induces heartfelt laughter when put even in the most simplest situations.Though he barely spoke any coherent words his jovial actions more than made up for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when driving in his beloved Mini Mr.Bean still manages to cause inadvertent chaos.Not very much is known about his background but his ability to draw tears of laughter from the audience at his funny shenanigans is well known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before he found fame Nick Hancock can be seen in a couple of the episodes&#34;
b&#39;Though several scenes of Wirey Spindell can be described as &#34;over the top&#34;. I thought that it was refreshing to see something that was willing to go to a level of near-taboo twisted comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wirey Spindell is a great film with great dialog. I wouldn\&#39;t say that this film is for everyone, but the film is on my top 10 list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can look beyond it\&#39;s occasional offensiveness and watch it for the film that it is, I would hope you could see it in the same light that I do.&#39;
b&#39;One of the best ever. Direction, fotography, a thrilling and dramatic history, wonderful soundtrack and, most of all, the incredible credibility of Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn, the best and most underestimated &#34;under-40 generation&#34; actor. After seeing this movie i guess if there\&#39;s anyone who couldn\&#39;t have any doubt about giving death to another man, in spite of the ugly things he could have done?&#39;
b&#39;Where do I begin? Walt Disney\&#39;s happiest motion picture &#34;Lady and the Tramp&#34; is one of, if not possibly, my favourite in the theatrical canon of Disney animation. The sequel, however, is... to say the very least, enjoyable. I enjoyed myself throughout the whole movie. It was, (flame-shield up!) adorable! The Broadway style of the songs and the movie kind of worked, and I was humming the songs for the rest of the night. I can, if you asked me to, still sing all of the songs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But where the movie was (really) good for me, it was bad in a lot of other places. The animation was kind of scary at times. Every time there was a close up shot of someones face, I don\&#39;t know... it just seemed scary to me. Also, where the hell was Lady? She gets like two lines of dialogue and only doggy hugs Scamp at the end. She gets 0% interaction with the plot and her only son!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all in all, I liked it. Compared to the original does it hold up? No. The songs aren\&#39;t as good (still kind of catchy though), the plot was a lot less involved, Lady had almost nothing to do with it, and it\&#39;s not as cute as the first one. But, if you go in with an open mind, you\&#39;ll have fun, and maybe \&#39;gasp!\&#39; Like it?&#39;
b&#34;I was stunned by this film. Afterwards, I didn&#39;t even want to see any films for a long time- any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For many, it may be the worst of Antonioni- very slow, without an engaging conventional story line, microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions- and the worst of Wenders- verbose, confused transcendentalism. It is composed of short distinct episodes linked by Wenders&#39; typical meandering hero&#39;s stream of consciousness, so it doesn&#39;t produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for fans, the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching a single poetic image that stretches across the film. Wenders and Antonioni create a discourse between their segments that seeks out the heart of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;
b&#39;It\&#39;s too bad iameracing wants to deny the reality of Faulkner\&#39;s and Clarence Brown\&#39;s purpose in the creating of the story and film of &#34;Intruder In The Dust&#34;. I suppose the burden of a history of racism is difficult for any Southerner to bear and I can understand that. But to say that this film was not specifically about racism is ridiculous and inaccurate. YES (to borrow your use of the upper case) iameracing, there are many many many places where blacks and white people in the South get along quite well. But to deny the way that black people were and sometimes still are forced to live, the conditions and injustices they have had to endure are not imaginary. Sometimes black and white people got along because of genuine affection and understanding. Sometimes it was only as long as blacks \&#39;knew their place\&#39;. The point of making Juano Hernandez character (in film and print) a somewhat prickly type, not warm and fuzzy, was to underscore the fact that bigotry is wrong in and of itself and human rights are just that for everyone regardless of whether we like a particular individual or not. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would do iameracing good to stop denying the existence of racism and the great harm it has done to Americans of all stripes. The fact is that black people (among others) did not, as a rule, not an exception, receive the benefits of the justice system as even-handedly as whites. Segregation, discrimination and lynching are historical fact. People like iameracing might claim these things were not as widespread as some think and would probably love to exonerate their ancestors and heroes from any connection with such behavior. It would be a wonderful thing if iameracing\&#39;s Southern ancestors (if any)never participated in any of the horrible racist actions that mar this country\&#39;s history and I hope they didn\&#39;t. If that is so congratulations to them but that fact, if true, does not erase the fact that others did. And even if the horrible things that were done to blacks in the South (and other areas, let\&#39;s not forget the Draft Riots of the Civil War Era)were only half as numerous, only a third, does that make them any less horrible? Is the murder of ten children the hanging of ten men the sexual assault of ten women any less horrible than the same things happening to a hundred? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iameracing asks us to get the &#34;Mississippi Burning&#34; chip off of our shoulders before we see &#34;Intruder In The Dust&#34;, well I ask you, did the murders of the civil rights activists happen or not? Why should that be forgotten? Forgiven? Maybe. But in order to prevent their recurrence they cannot be forgotten or revised into minor occurrences. The racism that is displayed in &#34;Intruder In The Dust&#34; is displayed there quite purposely. It is there to make a point. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a cinematically historical level it is also ridiculous for iameracing to discount the racial angle. Any viewer of films that were filmed before the 1960\&#39;s knows that black actors/characters/extras were usually deliberately cast. To judge from our movie history; wars were always fought by middle aged white men; There were no black people in the Old West; it was possible to walk down a street in a major city and never encounter a black person; there were no black hospital orderlies,taxi drivers,clerks, salespeople etc. Blacks were almost never cast with regard to a role unless race was a factor. If Falukner (and Brown) had wanted to tell a simple murder story he probably would not have made the Hernandez character black. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Racism exists iameracing. Probably for different reasons I am sure, we both wish that it didn\&#39;t but it does. Wanting things to be the way we would like them to be probably can\&#39;t be helped but it still does not make them so.&#39;
b&#39;On monday, earlier this week, sometime in July, I happened to be under the influence of the sweet leaf, and me being a horror fan, wanted to see something scary. I was thinking of The Ammityville Horror 2, but I got something way better. I was at my friend\&#39;s house, and he had the VHS Evil Ed. No cover or anything, he didn\&#39;t even see the whole thing himself, but he told me it was about &#34;A guy who goes crazy and kills a lot of people.&#34; Well, this movie was very shocking,I\&#39;ve never seen the actual brutal nature of sadistic violence until this movie, It buries Ted Bundy and Ed Gein both! It is pretty funny too, with references to The Evil Dead trilogy( and plus the Evil Dead 2 poster is everywhere in the movie!) The movie is about Edward, a obsessive-compulsive, nice guy, who happens to be a film editor. He is then lent to another department in the building, and he is sent to the posh yet violent world of Sam Campbell, the Splatter and Gore department. Sam Campbell, Eddy\&#39;s new boss, is telling Eddy about the big break on his movies, the gruesome Loose Limbs series, and he needs Eddy to make the movie somewhat less violent so they can be shown all over Europe. Eddy has his regrets soon, as the images and scenes that are displayed to him from the lonely suburban house he is sent to work in, and then, what happens from there is truly nightmarish. Imagine yourself in his place! The acting is great, the overdubbing is little funny (Sam Campbell\&#39;s voice is often found funny, same with the other actors). However, the overdubbing job was done pretty good, I give this movie a 10/10, and it\&#39;s a good introduction to the Gore sub-genre to Horror. Very good, Nightmarish, bloody.......You just have to see it for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;quote from movie: &#34;Where in the f**k is my Beaver rape scene?!&#34;&#39;
b&#34;I finally managed to see this movie...after so many years of expectancy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so curious to see if this movie it is as bad as some people say..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And my opinion is that this movie it wasn&#39;t bad at all,on the contrary it was AMAZING...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed every second from it...from the beginning until the end...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actors were great they sent me the feeling that i was living the story at the same time as the movie was playing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The landscapes were so beautiful were the film was shot...and it did charmed me.. Also the music was extraordinary and i have nothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to reproach..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the plot was very original i don&#39;t think that i saw a movie like this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a shame that it isn&#39;t recognized all over the world..to bad for those who didn&#39;t get the chance to see it. i give this movie 10/10&#34;
b&#34;This is the kind of movie that you rent when you are incredibly tired, or impaired in some other way... The acting in this movie is so bad it seems intentional, and to let you know how bad the special effects are, there is one scene when the puppets are coming alive where you can see most of a hand holding the puppet, moving it about. The movie looked as if it was filmed with a camcorder. When I saw this movie for the first time, a fistfight nearly erupted when my friends and I were calling each other names from this flick, that&#39;s how terrible it was. If you enjoy getting mad at movies, I recommend this to you, otherwise, flee as though your very life depended on it.&#34;
b&#34;Alright, so maybe the impersonations of Jay Leno and David Letterman are not spot on, but you still get a sense of who these people are and how they operate behind the screen. Bob Balaban and Treat Williams are excellant as Warren Littlefield and Micheal Ovitz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie doesn&#39;t go for joke and punchline but it is still funny. Kathy Bates in particular is amazing as Leno&#39;s manager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny, amazing, interesting, very watchable, this is a good TV movie.&#34;
b&#39;For a TV movie this was definately worth seeing. All the acting was very well done and the story itself had a touching universal theme. I have not read/seen the original and as a rule I can\&#39;t stand Shakespeare, but I enjoyed this movie(the civil war setting was very well done as well). Dont expect to see an epic, however you should find it moving enough to enjoy. By the way (on a side note) don\&#39;t compare this (or any other movie for that matter) to the original work. Movies aren\&#39;t supposed to transfer a book to the screen, but rather take the general idea of it a then adapt a story from it. When people say &#34;the book was so much better&#34; (they\&#39;re usually wrong anyway) what they are really trying to say is the book was so different.&#39;
b&#34;Not only was this film exhilarating, but it took me back down memory lane with its true to life sound track. These were the things we were saying, and doing...these were the songs we were listening to...all during this same time period, in the same era, way down south in Alabama. I may not have been one of the skateboard set, but I was definitely one of the observers, sitting on the curb with the old transistor radio, listening to Neil Young, watching those more brave than I ever hoped to be, as they put the spin on their surfboards on wheels, applying the tricks of Alva and Adams, hoping that maybe, just maybe for a brief moment, they&#39;d adopt the Zephyr style. It just goes to show how much alike we all were during those wonderful days. ~ KLJ&#34;
b&#34;I have been looking forward to the release of this DVD (and it&#39;s follow-up {Female Prisoner Scorpion: #701&#39;s Grudge Song}) for some time. I very much enjoyed the first two movies of this series. After just watching this film, I would have to say that this is probably my favorite of the three. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three of these movies were directed by Shunya Ito. What is great about them, though, is that, even though they all feature the same lead character (wonderfully played by Meiko Kaji), they are each vastly different from the others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first movie (Female Prisoner #701: Scorpion) is more or less a typical Women In Prison movie. But the character of Scorpion is very intriguing - very reminiscent of the anti-heroes of many spaghetti westerns. And the director often used some very interesting and unusual visual approaches to the material. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second movie (Female Convict Scorpion: Jailhouse 41) is a real tour-de-force. Not so much a WIP movie as the bulk of the film has Scorpion and six other escaped inmates on the lam. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie (Female Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable) is the third in the series and the last one directed by Shunya Ito. This one plays out as much more of a crime drama. Once again, our heroine is on the run. But this time out, she has managed to maintain a certain amount of normalcy in her life (relatively speaking anyway). She gets a job, she finds a place to live, she makes a friend on the outside. But, of course, everything has to unravel eventually. FPS: Beast Stable has a more straight-forward story that is told at a more leisurely pace than its predecessors. But I found it to be engaging from beginning to end. And don&#39;t worry: there is still plenty of depravity to go around in this movie! But I think these movies transcend most exploitation films because the more disturbing elements are played in a straighter tone rather than being used exclusively for in-your-face shock value. Yes, there were definitely moments in this movie where I cringed mightily. But I didn&#39;t feel that they detracted from the value of the story (well, maybe a time or two). One thing I have greatly enjoyed about these films is the continued build-up of Scorpion&#39;s mythos. With this entry character development is used much more extensively than in the previous two. We get to see that she is much more than just a stone-hearted vengeful badass!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned earlier in this review, a fourth movie followed. It also features Meiko Kaji as Scorpion but had a different director. Without giving anything away I want to mention that FPS: Beast Stable ends in such a way as to make a sequel completely unnecessary. The fourth film is still quite good but it seems to play as a superfluous footnote to a mind-blowing trilogy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in out-of-the-ordinary films. FPS: Beast Stable can be enjoyed as a stand-alone piece (as can the first two movies) but I would also recommend watching the others first if you have not already done so.&#34;
b&#39;This movie is an amazing comedy.. the script is too funny.. if u watch it more than once you will enjoy it more. Though the comedy at times is silly but it really makes u laugh!! Salman Khan and Aamir Khan have given justice to their roles. After 1994 i have not come across any hindi movie which was as funny as this.&#39;
b&#34;From producer/writer/Golden Globe nominated director James L. Brooks (Terms of Endearment, As Good as It Gets) this is a really good satirical comedy film showing behind the scenes in the life of a news reporter/anchor/journalist or producer might be like. Basically Jane Craig (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Holly Hunter) falls for new reporter Tom Grunick (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated William Hurt), but correspondent Aaron Altman (Oscar nominated Albert Brooks) also has strong feelings for her. The network prepares for big changes, and sparks will fly with all members of the studio. Also starring Jack Nicholson as anchor Bill Rorich, Moonraker&#39;s Lois Chiles as Jennifer Mack, Mrs. Doubtfire&#39;s Robert Prosky as Ernie Merriman, School of Rock&#39;s Joan Cusack as Blair Litton, Peter Hackes as Paul Moore, Christian Clemenson as Bobby, Robert Katims as Martin Klein, Ed Wheeler as George Wein and Stephen Mendillo as Gerald Grunick. The comedy is subtle but strong, the romance has it&#39;s moments, and it is certainly a believable situation film. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Screenplay - Motion Picture. It was number 64 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!&#34;
b&#34;I remember years ago BBC1 used to show this movie in a very cut form. I tracked it down on video a couple of years ago and viewed it again. The film although slow and slightly odd (the mountain men look very strange) the atmosphere was eerily effective. It&#39;s one of my favorite slasher films and I have no idea where an uncut version can be found. Currently deleted everywhere (except the USA where it was accidentally put on a horror compilation!). It&#39;s a shame you cannot get this movie as it was meant to be seen. Wrong turn (the recent Stan Winston produced movie) owes a great deal to Just Before Dawn. One of the better 80&#39;s slasher films and deserves to be seen by a wider audience.&#34;
b&#34;I&#39;ve never watched a file in a language I don&#39;t understand just because I wanted to see the movie and I couldn&#39;t find it with English subs. I don&#39;t know how much I missed but it wasn&#39;t much. Probably just specific details which sounds silly until you see the emotional level of this movie and how the characters interact together. I want to mention to The Diceman from Germany there&#39;s no reason to feel that he &#39;sucks&#39; when it comes to commenting on the emotional strength of the film. Like I said, I don&#39;t understand Japanese -or at least only the very small amount I came away with from reading the very lengthy novel -pro- bably my favorite all time book which I could not put down &amp; took the next day off from work just to finish reading! I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s an English dubbed or subbed version but if the film but if there is I&#39;d love to see it. The film was incredible in Japanese anything better is icing of the cake!! Slainte&#39;, Maegi&#34;
b&#39;Director and auteur Jean-Pierre Rappenau was 8 years old during the spring of 1940 as France\&#39;s Third Republic disintegrated in a matter of a few weeks. It was a time, he says, when &#34;all the adults were a little bit insane.&#34; He and the production staff have lovingly and meticulously recreated that world in a film where all the characters are essentially fictional. The structure, a classic farce, is ideal for the period as multiple plot lines zip and intersect only to come together in a logical, satisfying conclusion. The peg for this plot is Frederic, played by brilliant newcomer Gregory Derangere, who is fully up to playing opposite Adjani, Depardieu and Ledoyen. The real strength of the film is in its supporting performances. M. Rappeneau has cast the film exquisitely with actors who volunteered ideas for both action and dialogue and who know and prove that it is possible to fully realize a character with just two short sentences of dialogue. Though not yet as widely influential as Renoir\&#39;s \&#39;Rules of the Game,\&#39; \&#39;Bon Voyage\&#39; richly deserves to be a companion piece to that classic. Though it demands a lot of the audience, it gives much back. One of its demands is tolerance for a certain coyness and misdirection as to the exact genre we are watching: a crime melodrama, no, a spy thriller, ah, a romantic comedy. Recommend it to cinemaphile friends. Just be sure to let them discover for themselves that it is a romantic comedy.&#39;
b&#39;&#34;Showtime&#34; is a funny film starring funnymen Robert DeNiro (Meet the Parents,A Bronx Tale) and Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Dr. Dolittle). The story is this: In the beginning of the movie detective Mitch (Robert DeNiro) and another detective go into a tv store trying to bust some criminals. When the cops arrive, Tray(Eddie Murphy)a cop, tries to arrest Mitch not knowing he\&#39;s a cop. During this scene loads of funny things happen which catch the eye of tv producer Chase Ritz. She is so excited about their adventures together, she decides to make a tv show called &#34;Showtime&#34; starring Tray (the cop) and Mitch (the detective). But that\&#39;s just the funny part. The rest is strictly suspense and action. There is a foreign man who is selling and making extremely dangerous guns. While playing LAPD on the show and doing it in real life, DeNiro and Murphy have quite an adventure in this story. On a scale of 1-10, I give it a seven or 8.&#39;
b&#34;I Loved this movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade to this comedy level, which is at the very top of the line in my opinion. A no drink movie, you laugh so hard you will spill it all over yourself. Can We expect more? Let&#39;s hope so. I would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake. Mel Brookes made some remakes of classic films.He made some very strong contributions. A Picture of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion. I hope some producer or director can get into the idea and bring us new comedy to our screens. we are needing a good insurgence of comedy to keep our level of laughter higher than ever before. A good Comedy FIX.&#34;
b&#39;This relic from before the days of the Production Code and the Hays Office is good fun, not great but entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on a song by Rogers &amp; Hart that was an enormous hit at the time, the story revolves around dance hall girl Barbara Stanwyck who is romanced by wealthy businessman Ricardo Cortez (who was indecently handsome), but whose heart belongs to her bookish neighbor Monroe Owsley. She and Owsley marry, but keep it a secret, while she dismisses Cortez, who still holds out hope. She helps hubby get a job in Cortez\&#39;s company, but married bliss quickly turns sour as Owsley develops a taste for the high life and steps out with a college sweetheart and gambles in high-stakes bridge (Yup! I know, it\&#39;s pretty funny....). Finally he embezzles $5,000 from Cortez, and is about to go on the lam, when his devoted wife goes to Cortez....and I won\&#39;t reveal anything else, although the ending was certainly a surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stanwyck is the best thing about this movie; in one of her earliest roles she\&#39;s quite accomplished. Owsley is the weak point; he\&#39;s unattractive and sniveling, while Cortez is amazingly suave and sexy, while his performance is earnest but unremarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While ostensibly a drama, it\&#39;s filled with laughs, many inadvertant as some elements of this movie have aged very poorly. But there are a lot of good witty lines; at one point Stanwyck says to Cortez, &#34;My brains are in my feet, while yours are in....&#34; That\&#39;s pretty darn suggestive for 1931! There\&#39;s a lot of bawdy and suggestive stuff in this flick, in the last days before the Code clamped down and whitewashed everything. An amusing antique, a good reminder of how far we haven\&#39;t come in 70 years....this story could very easily be changed to fit 2003 but could keep the basic plot, with the original ending, in place.&#39;
b&#39;The greatest movie ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How\&#39;s that for a contention? However, if we look at it through purely cinematic terms, it is clear that Three Colours Red is a masterpiece. It is not enough to merely say this - Three Colours Red is the masterpiece of world cinema. If you accept that Citizen Kane is not human enough, if you accept that Star Wars is not actually very good, if you accept that Ozu and Mizoguchi both have to take a step back - then Three Colours Red is the foremost masterpiece of all time. As a discussion into human morality, Three Colours Red works on an intensely metaphysical level, with a depth that none can match. Blue went almost as far into the human psyche, but stopped as it was going to pull the rabbit out of the hat. White forced us to reflect on the humanity of equality - this, in retrospect, was better still, but still not quite there. Red, however, is the real thing. What he expresses in this movie, is an expression of what it is to be human. In fact, what he expresses is _how_ it is to feel human. It forces us to examine up to the minutest detail, the very nature of our souls, of our ethical selves. In Red, one may find meaning on one of its several levels. On the first level, Red achieves a high level of verisimilitude - we could have no trouble in calling Red an exceptionally entertaining story. However, the coincidences inherent in the film and its conceits force us to examine the movie as a movie. It is as if Kieslowski is saying: &#34;Ceci n\&#39;est pas la r\xc3\xa9alit\xc3\xa9&#34;. In effect, in pursuing a humanistic goal, Kieslowski can also challenge reality. It is a trick that Kieslowski has been attempting since Le Double Vie de V\xc3\xa9ronique, but not until this, his final film, did he finally manage to reach this divine intertwining of fate, philosophy and circumstance. The actors and actresses, too, appear to be at the mercy of a greater power. Valentine (Ir\xc3\xa8ne Jacob), is aptly name, for she seems to represent an almost pure love. Meanwhile, the idea of first impressions is challenged by Jean-Louis Tritignant\&#39;s Judge Kern, a cantankerous man, who, by the end, becomes an almost all-knowing observer of events - a character who symbolically seems to possess the power to bring characters together - a power to make people happy, a power which he could only achieve through Valentine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a capability to see films as more than just a series of pictures. In fact, films have the potential to possess more meaning than literature. It won\&#39;t happen, of course, but at least we have the power to view this film, knowing that it gives us the power to achieve the something that we can\&#39;t define, but all possess. A synopsis of this film read: &#34;A film about a woman who runs over a dog&#34;. Well, it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isn\&#39;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Simon Huxtable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;
b&#34;Sometimes a movie is so bad it&#39;s kind of good. This movie was made in Germany and is dubbed in English, so you have to get past that. The acting also was stilted and forced, other than what was done by the real rats, who IMO did an excellent job of acting the part. Snaps to the rat wrangler. Anyway, the mayor of the city has decided to cut costs and the local garbage collectors go on strike as a result, thus leaving large piles of trash everywhere. This storyline has been used before, not to mention has happened in real life (too often unfortunately) and the audience is not in for any surprises. But this is fine. We know what&#39;s going to happen and when, and sometimes an audience needs a movie where a lot of brain cells are not necessary to follow along. We have our hero, down to the chiseled face and body, the semi-hero(s), and of course our heroine, who happens to be the doctor, but only still in training, though it is she who discovers what really is going on when so many people end up sick and dying, and not just from a rat bite. Of course the villain must die (okay, all the villains, meaning the rats), and the ending scene is one of those that reminds the audience that a sequel is in the works. This is one of those movies that you just sit back and enjoy for what it is and what it is not.&#34;
b&#34;How do these guys keep going? They&#39;re about 50 years old each, and act as if they&#39;re only 30. They play 3 hours of music at every concert, and barely break a sweat. This DVD is their first concert in Rio, Brazil. Although the people don&#39;t speak English, they try to memorize the words to the most famous Rush songs, and try to sing a foreign language at the concert with their best friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Tom Sawyer to The Spirit of Radio, this concert DVD will keep you in the chair not wanting to pause or move away from the classics that you&#39;ve listened to when you were young. This is their 30th reunion tour (started in 1974). I went to their Scranton PA concert, and this was just as good, although in PA they didn&#39;t play Freewill, so I was upset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have Freewill, they have The Trees, they have YYZ, The Pass, Driven, Dreamline, Red Sector A, Limelight, Roll the Bones, 2112, and much more. 10 out of 10, because nothing else compares. If you never go to a Rush concert, then at least buy this DVD.&#34;
b&#34;This really is a movie that you need to see twice. When I first saw this film I was really drawn into the story. While the majority of the story takes place inside of a hotel room, the stories that Buddy (Nick Drake, wonderful allusion) and Daphne share take you outside of their room and into their world. Through their conversations you get a feel for the loneliness and pain that each feels. The soundtrack accompanies the movie perfectly, dark, lo-fi and intriguing. When you see the film the second time around you can pick up all of the clues that you missed the first time around leading up to one of the best ending I have seen in a long time. I hope to see this movie find a distributor for the DVD so that it will be more accessible. Great movie, you won&#39;t be disappointed.&#34;
b&#39;This greatest movie gives us clue to the depth of our souls in most deadly moments of our lives. My heart is shrinking every time I saw the scene of hanging. I have no words any... You must see this brilliant picture.&#39;
b&#39;The influences of other science fiction and thriller movies and stories are evident throughout this film. The movies that come to mind immediately are Alien, Aliens, and Starship Troopers. The story itself is fairly straightforward and not all that original, hibernated traveling through space, crash landing on planet with no apparent life and a &#34;deserted&#34; geological expedition - except when the lights go out, forcing different types of people to work together toward their mutual survival, while the body count mounts. This kind of movie always tends to be fun, as long as it\&#39;s done well. I believe that Pitch Black was done well. The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn\&#39;t make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vin Diesel plays Riddick, the stereotypical convicted criminal who has a murderous past, physically prowess, high tolerance for pain, and conveniently can see in the dark. You know he is going to end up doing the right thing at some point in the movie, because it\&#39;s hinted throughout the movie that he actually may have a conscience about things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cole House plays the drug-addicted bounty hunter who\&#39;s probably in many ways a real bad guy compared to Riddick, as his character reveals itself throughout the movie. It is most likely that he is most courageous when the odds and firepower are in his favor. A very self-serving character that in the end gets what he deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Radha Mitchell plays the co-pilot on the doomed vessel, who is jolted out of deep sleep because the ship ran through a meteor swarm or the tail end of a comment. Finding the pilot dead in his sleeping chamber she attempts to land the ship, which leads to our discovery of that\&#39;s character\&#39;s potentially fatal flaw - fear of responsibility, accountability, and being a leader. Her character in the short span of the story probably grows the most, in that she actually grows some conviction, takes charge, and doesn\&#39;t sit around waiting to be gobbled up by night stalking aliens. She in some strange way connects with the ever-distant human side of Riddick, who in turn in the end, respects her for her choices and her sticking with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story in some cases plays out as you would expect it, but I think you\&#39;ll be mildly surprised by which characters survive this harrowing experience. This movie is an entertaining train-wreck in progress to watch. Go watch it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;
b&#34;The Claude Lelouch&#39;s movie is a pretty good moment of cinema. One of the most touching films about family and loneliness, and surely the best interpretation of French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo.&#34;
b&#39;It was good to see John Denver again though he passed several years ago. I found this film to be very heartwarming and a great film to sit by the fire on a cold winters night recollecting what Christmas is all about. The scenes of Georgetown, Colorado were magnificent and make one want to move there immediately. As I sit here in my own mountain seen in So California I loved the story and the plot. I hope all who see this somewhat older film enjoy it as much as my mother and I did. Merry Christmas! A great film for all the family too see. Enoy and tell others about it. Thanks for the memories. We need to have more films like this come out of Hollywood.&#39;
b&#39;I loved this movie and I watch it everyday. I think that although the acting isn\&#39;t all that great, it\&#39;s really just a bunch of guys having fun with a script. I had been looking all over for this movie, for almost a year, and when I found it for thirty dollars, I just had to get it. It is now, by far my favorite movie of all time. It deals with relationship failure, and at the same time making a joke of it. I loved all the parts with Don Vito, especially the one where Valo asks him for a grape when they\&#39;re sitting on the porch, and He tells him to eat the one rolling down the porch. IT really portrays him as he really is. The part in the &#34;Making Of&#34; really touched me, when they adressed Brandon Novak\&#39;s addiction to heroin, and how much his friends and family were trying to help him. A new movie that\&#39;s in the making, called &#34;Dreamseller,&#34; is in production, which is about the story of Novak\&#39;s dreams, shattered by his addiction.&#39;
b&#34;Welsh poet Dylan Thomas excused from serving in active duty is doing his bit for the war effort producing bits of prose for some propaganda branch of government in Whitehall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas is portrayed as a freethinker believing in free love married to a woman with an equally demanding artistic streak and likewise with a penchant for extramarital romance. Thomas writing and reciting his poetry in systematic domestic mayhem throughout becomes somewhat priggish towards the end, resting somewhat uncomfortably on his society connections and pulling rank on a war veteran, who had shot up his house, and who was incidentally married to the woman he had been having an affair with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real story of this film is the love of two women, one (Keira Knightley) whose first love was Thomas (Matthew Rhys), the second (Sienna Miller) who is Thomas&#39;s wife. At times it reminds of The Singing Detective, as in very good television with slightly sinister overtones laid on top of scenes of surreal camp absurdity.&#34;
b&#39;Some will say this movie is a guilty pleasure. I loved this flick but I don\&#39;t feel guilty about it. You can tell the whole cast and crew had fun making this movie. But Jack Frost 2 won\&#39;t go over well with some people. Right from the beginning you can tell this movie will be cheesy and it definitely has an amateurish look to it. Well, if you get the privilege to watch this movie, after watching it remember that Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman is a pleasure, not a guilty pleasure. Now, because I can\&#39;t fill up ten lines heres some great scenes: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**SPOILERS** &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three women on the beach had great deaths. The first one had Jack in a tree trying to drop icicles on one of them. He kept missing so he dropped an anvil on her. The next woman fell on a bed of icicles. The last one was stabbed in the eyes with tongs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other great one was where two surfers stoners are hanging out near a frozen pole. One of them gets their tongue stuck on it (of course). Jack Frost pulls him back a rips his tongue off while saying &#34;COWA-TONGUE-A DUDE!&#34;. Well, you have to see it for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course, the snowball children kicked ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**END SPOILERS**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;infinity stars&#39;
b&#39;I really love this movie. It has a very real feel to it. I believe it was never popular because of the subject matter, however, because of the subject matter, it makes the movie all that much more important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an &#34;A&#34; movie and I recommend it highly. If you liked &#34;1984&#34; book or movie, I think you will like this one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is harsh, to say the least, including mental and physical acts of torture, some pretty vile. Not for the week at heart or stomach. No gore, but his movie is so great at projecting the mental anticipation it doesn\&#39;t need blood and guts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not a realist or a pestimistic person I don\&#39;t think you will enjoy it. It leaves you with an uneasy feeling about humans, what they\&#39;re capable of, and the very real possibility that our government(s)does not necessarily have our personal best interest in it\&#39;s heart.&#39;
b&#34;I&#39;ve read the comments on Las Vegas and do agree with some of them, it&#39;s not brain surgery TV, but then again I was under the impression that TV was mainly for escapism, especially with what is going on in today&#39;s world. Let&#39;s face it, a show about Vegas (that isn&#39;t a reality based programme) isn&#39;t going to one based on reality because to me Vegas is pure fantasy! It&#39;s the sort of place where we can go and pretty much do what we want when we want (subject to funds obviously!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore the fact that Las Vegas is pretty, sexy and cliched with characters that reflect all this seems to be on the money in my eyes. If you don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t watch it, that what we have a million channels for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#39;re coming up to the third episode here in the UK and I know that I will be making a beeline to watch it again. I just hope it&#39;s not cancelled, something that seems to be happening a lot with most of the shows that come to the UK that are half decent! (Firefly and Jake 2.0 anyone?!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s harmless, great looking fun and everytime I watch it, I want to go back to the real thing :)&#34;
b&#39;I managed to obtain an original BBC broadcast of this film on video and loved it so much I had to try and locate the original video in its original box; thanks go to Ebay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deleted on any format since 1990, this exceptional wildlife film is finely constructed and well acted. Directed by Stewart Raffil (MAC &amp; Me), the scenes of leaping Tigers running through the Alaskan wilderness is nothing short of stunning and its timeless tale of a trapper trying to survive on his own in the frozen wastes with two young tiger cubs is moving on each viewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why no major company has picked up this movie to distribute on DVD is a big wonder; but makes it that extra special to know its also hard to locate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find this film by chance or eventually track it down to add to your collection, make sure never to let it vanish out of your grasp. Films of this calibre, as shown, don\&#39;t come often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A true masterpiece in every sense of the word, and highly worthy of its praised comments, &#34;WHEN THE NORTH WIND BLOWS&#34; will sink deep into your heart as soon as you see it.&#39;
b&#39;You think the police are always right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You believe that &#34;eye-witnesses&#34; are always right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You believe the prosecutors will not take a case to court if lazy police have failed to perform 98% of a basic investigation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You believe a U.S. city might have a &#34;few bad apples&#34; in law enforcement, but that the &#34;good cops&#34; will quickly nip those who systematically engage in evil-for-evil\&#39;s sake in the bud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You believe that the possibility of an ex-football lineman being instated as a detective solely because his dad is the county sheriff, and being allowed to beat &#34;confessions&#34; out of randomly-selected teenagers with absolutely no fear of negative consequences to himself could happen in the America of the 1930s, but not today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You believe a judge will NOT send a case to the jury if anyone with a brain in their head can see the defendant is a totally random passer-by nabbed by the police because it was hot, and they did not feel like working that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You believe that all the innocent people imprisoned six months here or 20 years there are &#34;exceptions to the rule,&#34; and an injustice like this could NEVER involve your family member, someone in the middle class, or someone like YOU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You think that you are aware of every terrible, indisputable, 100% proved outrage of the last 10 years in America--yet you haven\&#39;t seen this film.&#39;
b&#34;This is a movie about a man everybody thinks is Jewish.This is a movie about Lawrence Newman, who lives in Brooklyn in the 1940&#39;s, at the time of WWII.One day, when he gets himself glasses, people start thinking he&#39;s a Jew.And that only, because he looks like one.And he lives in a very antisemitic neighborhood.So some people start treating him like dirt.They make that judgment, being a Jew, of Larry&#39;s fresh wife, Gertrude Hart, too.That makes their lives unbearable.Neal Slavin&#39;s Focus (2001) is a fairly good look at the antisemitism.That&#39;s a problem that won&#39;t go away.The movie is based on Athur Miller&#39;s novel, which, I admit, I haven&#39;t read.But the movie is really good, so I&#39;m sure the book would also.The actors do good job.William H.Macy is always good, and his work as Larry Newman is brilliant.Laura Dern is Gert Hart and she&#39;s magnificent.Meat Loaf is almost scary as the neighbor who wants to keep Jews out by any means necessary.David Paymer&#39;s character as the Jewish shop-owner Mr. Finkelstein is the most sympathetic in the movie.Paymer is the perfect choice for the role.One of the greatest scenes is in the end when Mr.Finkelstein and Newman fight against those Nazi-like people with baseball bats.They join together to fight the evil.The Christian and the Jew.&#34;
b&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my favorite science fiction, incredible ride through mistrust and the warping of reality. Probably the best performance I have ever seen Jude Law play. Incredibly original with interesting character developments and a story line that twists and turns so rapidly that it takes a couple of minutes after the film to fully grasps its genius. Even more fun watching it again for the end changes the beginning.&#39;
b&#39;&#34;Man of the Year&#34; tells the story of Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) a political comedian (like Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert) who has his own television show. On his show he talks about all sorts of things but his main focus are political issues which he is very opinionated about. One day on his show, a fan from the audience raises the idea that Dobbs should run for President of the United States. After that episode aired, millions flocked to the web to create various petitions and voice their opinions on why Dobbs would make a great candidate for the President for the United States. A few weeks later, Dobbs decides to run for President and low and behold wins the election. Everything seems to be going as planned until a woman by the name of Eleanor Green (Laura Linney) shows up and starts some controversy regarding his position. A funny yet serious political thriller ensues\xc2\x85 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man anyone walking into this film expecting to see a brainless comedy will surely be disappointed. I always wonder how some people are film marketers when I see how misleading their marketing campaigns. &#34;Man of the Year&#34; is a great example of bad and misleading marketing, because everything from the poster, to the trailer, to the online advertisements makes this movie look and feel like a comedy. I would honestly have to say about 1/3 of the film is funny while the rest of it plays off as a political thriller that makes good arguments and allows its audience to think. I kind of wonder in this case if the marketing was done on purpose since this film addresses pretty serious issues in-between its comedy routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But enough about marketing, lets get down to the film itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked &#34;Man of the Year&#34; even though I was expecting to see a comedy instead of a serious film. One of the many things I will give this film credit for is that the film does a decent job switching between comedy and drama even though at first it seems a little awkward. I really think that after you figure this out that the movie is going to be more of a political thriller than a comedy you get comfortable with it. Some may not because they are lead to believe that they are seeing a comedy and don\&#39;t understand what this film is trying to say in the end but for those people they can blame the marketers for not advertising this film right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Man of the Year&#34; talks about a lot of things and seems to have a very strong opinion. As Tom Dobbs speaks he is saying things that need to be said and isn\&#39;t about candy coating them. I also think the whole political subplot, while most critics say hurt the film probably again because of the misleading marketing, was very good. The idea of computerize voting has been tossed around the last few years and with all the problems computers have the issue being addressed in this film could surely be realistic. Also the control big businesses have over voting also gets addressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as acting goes, I think everyone involved did a good job. Robin Williams had a chance to be funny yet serious at the same time by playing Tom Dobbs. Some say that Williams has overstayed his welcome as a comedian but I personally still think he is funny and he\&#39;s a good serious actor as well. This is probably one of the few occasions though that we get to see him go back and forth from serious to funny and I think it works well. Also it\&#39;s nice to see Lewis Black co-star in a decent film. Again I like Black when he appears on &#34;The Daily Show&#34; and does stand up however most of the films he has been in were awful. This was a good movie for him because I think his political views fit in with the story that director Barry Levinson was trying to convey. Laura Linney is a fine addition to the cast and proves once again that she is a very good actress and lastly Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum both do a very good job as always with this roles handed to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Man of the Year&#34; was written and directed by Barry Levinson, the man who has brought us such films as &#34;Rain Man,&#34; &#34;Good Morning Vietnam,&#34; and &#34;Wag the Dog.&#34; Levinson does a fine job writing the film and directing it. Like I said I know a lot of critics didn\&#39;t like the whole political thriller aspect of the film but I thought it fit in nicely. It was actually nice to watch a mainstream movie that allowed me to both think and laugh at the same time. Barry Levinson did a fine job with this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, don\&#39;t go into this film expecting to see the movie that the commercials are selling you. It does have laughs but at the same time it plays off more as a political drama. It\&#39;s not as stupid or silly as the marketing campaign leads you to believe. I really liked the fact that this film that this film wasn\&#39;t a typical Hollywood film. It tried to be a comedy and a serious drama at the same time and worked at least for me. I like the fact that the film didn\&#39;t really tone down any of the issues it addressed nor did it have a typical Hollywood ending. I was trying to call the ending from the get go but surprisingly it didn\&#39;t end the way I thought which made me happy. It\&#39;s a movie that will make you laugh but then a few minutes later allow you to think and wonder what\&#39;s going to happen next. I think its a good movie that will be hurt by its bad marketing.&#39;
b&#39;this is more than a Sat. afternoon special. Exremely well written if very low key there is a lot here if you look for it. Catch the cat companion/scout for instance. It not only could have been a comic book it should have been a comic book. The comic industry (as well as the film\&#39;s publicists) missed the boat on this. One of the least know really great films. A great script by John Sayles is a strong point but the acting is good as well. Probably the best &#34;super hero&#34; film I\&#39;ve ever seen. Short on special effects but long on believability. This one\&#39;s a keeper. I have never seen a DVD of this film but i used to own a VHS version. Good hunting&#39;
b&#39;Several weeks back I lost my beloved companion and friend of fourteen years, a golden retriever named Sasha. When I came home from the animal hospital, alone, after having made one of the most painful decisions of my life, my teenage daughter sat by my side. . .and we talked about this episode of the Twilight Zone. I could be wrong, but I recall a line that Arthur Hunnicutt said, when Satan was trying to trick him into hell, but his dog could not go with him. . .and his dog in turn was growling in defiance at the gatekeeper who was trying to trick the old hunter to &#34;step inside,&#34;. . .that it would be &#34;one helluva of heaven if dogs were not allowed,&#34; and the spirit of the old mountain man and his dog decided to turn away from the gate (of what they had thought was heaven, to wander eternity alone.) What a tearful moment when they meet a &#34;good ole\&#39; country boy&#34; on that eternal road, only to discover he is an angel, sent out to find \&#39;em, and &#34;sure neighbor, of course dogs are allowed into heaven.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;ll confess I cried as I talked about this with my daughter while we mourned the passing of our beloved golden. Rod Serling was truly a genius, a voice that in the early sixties spoke out against racism, hatred, &#34;know-nothingism,&#34; and was a profound inspiration to me to become a writer. This episode, across forty five years carried a message of comfort to all of us who have lost a beloved friend. I urge you to get a copy the next time there is a one of the Twilight Zone marathons or purchase it. There will be some tears, but comfort as well. As always, thanks Rod, for all that you taught us. . .even now.&#39;
b&#39;Some time ago, we read of the results of a poll taken by some Newspaper Sports Writers. The Questions posed were only two, and were brief and right to the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Question Number 1 asked respondent to tell who was his most Beloved college football team. Question Number 2 asked the fan to name his most Hated college football team. The answer to both questions was simply, Notre Dame! ND is tops on both lists! Yeah, love \&#39;em or hate \&#39;em, but you sure don\&#39;t ignore ,em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The roots of this unique position of this Indepent* College Football Powerhouse are found in the life and career of one, grown-up, little Immigrant Norweigen boy from Chicago named Knute Rockne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a biopic, the production of KNUTE ROCKNE, ALL-American(1940), came out relatively close to the death of Coach Rockne in a 1930 plane crash. It was about 10 years after that the film was released. That would mean that preliminary work on the project started about 8 years after our Nation\&#39;s great loss of Mr. Rockne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His likeness and voice were well known from Newspapers, Radio and Motion Picture News Reels. Both Knute\&#39;s Widow,Bonnie Skiles Rockne, and the University of Notre Dame had approval rights in choosing the Actor to play the Lead and okaying the script. We think that they could not have done the job any better. Pat O\&#39;Brien truly looks the part and was himself a footballer in college. Ronald Reagan is cast in the pivotal role of George Gipp**, a free spirited student going to Notre Dame on a Baseball scholarship! He was a &#34;walk-on&#34; football player.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cast runs full of talented players. We have Griffith Veteran,Donald Crisp as Fr. Callaghan, C.S.C., Notre Dame President. Albert Basserman is Fr. Newland, the Chemistry Prof and Rockne mentor. Gail Page appears as the Mrs., Bonnie Skiles Rockne. Owen Davis,Jr. is Rockne cohort, Gus Dorais(the passer in that historic ND vs. ARMY Game at West Point.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cast is rounded out by Kane Richmond, Nick Lukats, William Marshall and William Byrne as the Four Horsemen. Real life Big Time College Coaches Howard Jones, \&#39;Pop\&#39; Warner, Bill Spaulding and Amos Alonzo Stagg appear as themselves in scenes of Congressional Probe into College Sports and add an authentic touch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for biopic,KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-American!,all one can only say that it hits the ground running, and did not slow down from beginning to end. There is no wasted time either. All the screen time is used to move the story along. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use of Notre Dame Choir, the Campus itself and all that Brass Band rah-rah march music all ad to the feeling of really being there.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* To this day,even though their Basketball Team and other sports teams compete in the Big East Conference, Notre Dame remains an Independent in NCAA Football. What this means, that in effect, The Fighting Irish play a national schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** There was no such agreement with the Family of George Gipp. There was a lawsuit some years ago over the scene portraying young Mr. Gipp giving the famous &#34;Win Onr For The Gipper Speech&#34;. Television prints of this KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-AMEICAN were minus the speech in the death bed scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Other Notre Dame themed Films were made over the years. THE SPIRIT OF NOTRE DAME (Universal 1931)featured J. Farrell McDonald as a Rockne look-alike coach. It also featured Lew Ayers, Andy Devine Nat Pendleton, as well as the members of the real Notre Dame Championship Teams featuring the real Four Horsemen. Then of course, we have RUDY (Tri-Star 1993)with Sean Astin, Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty and Charles Dutton, among others, in a fine cast. There was also talk of an unauthorized film, critical of Notre Dame called GOLDEN GLORY, but nothing has materialized, has it?(Let me know, Dear Reader, THANX!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** Warner Brothers always had great music in their, both in opening themes and in incidental music. In this Rockne Movie, they have incorporated THE NOTRE DAME FIGHT SONG in the score. Along with it were STEP NOTRE DAME and THE NOTRE DAME ALMA MATER, which had its premiere at the Rockne Funeral in 1930 at the Notre Dame Basilica.&#39;
b&#34;Even though i am slightly older than the recommended age group, I really enjoyed this movie. It&#39;s a little break from reality and it must be every little girls dream to become friends with a pop star. I know it was mine, to be sure! The first 10 minutes were really cheesy and the mean girls said a few things that were also slightly cheesy. Once you get over that, you can really start to enjoy it. I loved the relationship between JD and Jane - it was really sweet and you could see how much they began to like each other. The soundtrack is perfect and it fits into the film really well. I also liked the family set up for Jane, her sisters seemed lovely. Very well made film.&#34;
b&#34;I just saw this film last night, and I have to say that I loved every minute. If taken in the spirit of a parody of Bond-esquire films, it&#39;s truly superior. The true comedy of the film is in its blatant disregard for political correctness. The misogyny, cultural insensitivity, and almost laughable macho-ism of the films of this genre are used for major comic effect. It also calls the illogic and formulaic elements to task, with Agent OSS 117 constantly learning difficult things insanely quick (such as Arabic and how to play a traditional instrument) while missing some pathetically obvious clues. Some of the lines from the film left me laughing for hours after the movie was finished...and I have to say I have learned some...interesting...French vocabulary that would probably have my Professors quite exasperated with me were I to use. All in all, I thought this film excellent. Intensely funny and the first film I&#39;ve ever seen that truly parodies all aspects of the spy film.&#34;
b&#34;I actually though that Black Snake Moan was great movie which takes place in the south. The story follows a man named Lazarus whose wife dumps him for his brother and finds Rae abandoned and beaten up on the side of the road. Lazarus finds out that Rae is a sex addict and was abused as a child so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying up Rae with a chain to cure her of her wickedness. Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe that through their struggles and search for redemption that Lazarus and Rae become best friends. I was also amazed by Sam&#39;s ability to play an electric guitar and being able to sing. S Epatha Merrkensen is great as Lazarus&#39; love interest Angela, Justin Timberlake plays Rae&#39;s boyfriend Ronnie who is underused in the film but does the best that he can to deliver a fine performance.&#34;
b&#34;I wish there were more films about middle aged people. The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of life&#39;s moral highway make interesting viewing. There seems to be a different standard of judgement on women who have extra marital affairs than on men. Amy Watson&#39;s hurtful and humiliating behaviour towards her husband seems to pass without comment. Reverse the roles and one could expect a torrent of condemnation towards the man. If she found her husband boring and judgmental she could could have told him so, left and waited for a no doubt large financial settlement upon divorce. The country and London scenes are wonderfully authentic and rich while the autumnal weather adds to the melancholy background superbly. The ending is perfect, so in tune with real adult life.&#34;
b&#34;The banter and humorous rescue scene help to make this one of my favorites of the 14-movie series. Wonderful acting, great cast. And this movie contains one of the few oft-noted facts about Sean Bean&#39;s career. The part where he and Alice Krige fall off the horse into the water was not scripted but was left in since they both went right on acting after it happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good follow-up to the intense ending of Sharpe&#39;s Enemy.&#34;
b&#34;I really liked this movie. If other people want to give it an average around 5.0/10 that&#39;s their choice. I would give it 10/10. Sutherland&#39;s performance as a private eye is totally awesome. The story is amazing, human, exciting, intelligent. The dialogue is good. The story might not be perfect but anyway - the mood of the movie is good enough to compensate for that. Moreover, the ending is incredibly cool and their the jig-saw puzzle really comes back to together. So anyway I liked it. I also thought the female lead actress performed very well. I&#39;m not a big fan of detective movies but this one was really good, also because it doesn&#39;t give a damn about conventions of the supernatural.&#34;
b&#34;I have watched this movie at least ten times. I do not agree with the previous comments. This is a tongue in cheek movie and some of the acting is meant to be stilted. Men like Paul Cowley are few and far between, women like Linda, unfortunately, are a dime a dozen. The sad thing here is that although similiar relationships like this rarely lead to murder and frame ups, it is an all to familiar scenario. Boy worships girl, girl doesn&#39;t know he exists, they grow up, man sees woman he fantasized about down and out and rescues her. Bottom line, she never did love him-he came along at the right time and she used him. Thomas is excellent as the nerdy but adequate Paul. His portrayal is sensitive and touching. Madsen is perfect as the femme-fatale. What really moved me was the final scene. Paul says he eventually cried, but not for Linda, his wife, but for the unknown girl he had watched from a distance so many years ago..and longed for..and loved. And I loved the close-up of Thomas at the end.&#34;
b&#39;The first time I saw this film, I wanted to like it for so many reasons, but I simply did not. It just seemed a little dull. But there was a tiny question I had about something I saw near the beginning of the film so I watched it again\xc2\x85 and then finally it clicked for me. I first watched the movie knowing the &#34;surprise ending&#34;, and while I definitely wouldn\&#39;t recommend having the ending spoiled for you, I have still thoroughly enjoyed the bulk of the film and discovering the many seemingly insignificant events that all unravel to point to a very sinister scheme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t think that everyone will love this movie, or even like it. If you like any of the actors, you\&#39;ll like this movie because the acting is fairly strong and they all get a lot of screen time. If you like mysteries (namely Hitchcock) you\&#39;ll like this movie. If you like independent or psychological films, you\&#39;ll like this movie. It really worked for me on all of those levels. If you don\&#39;t like the actors, mysterious plots or psychological elements, you might not like this movie. But that\&#39;s your loss. Personally, the only thing that irked me a little was the accents. Good try, Alan Rickman, on the American dialect, but it wasn\&#39;t much improvement from the scene in Die Hard. (The wonderful voice makes up for the weird accent though.) The medley of accents in the movie was a little odd, but it was not so distracting that it became difficult or particularly irritating. Also, the camera change from scene to scene was evident and might bother some people, but I actually think it added to the scenes (or scene\xc2\x85 I can really only recall one scene where the change was severely different, but it worked).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you see this movie, see it at least twice. The second time you see it, I hope you realize how intricate the plot really is. Every time I watch this movie (it\&#39;s under an hour and a half so multiple viewings are not difficult) I seem to notice something else about it and find myself wondering, &#34;Why did that just happen?&#34; or &#34;Was that intentional?&#34; I like movies that make me think. This one does. So just see it. Twice.&#39;
b&#34;Just a short comment! I want to say that I like this movie very much! Sandra Bullock is my favourite actress. I like the whole story, from the beginning until the end! I have it on tape and I can watch it a 100 times, it doesn&#39;t matter!!!&#34;
b&#34;I was very excited to see Rock Star because I am a big fan of Mark Wahlberg&#39;s. I was surprised to have liked it more than I originally thought I would. The script did leave something to be desired, but the movie&#39;s performances made up for it. There were a few moments when visions of Spinal Tap came rushing back, and I can&#39;t help but think this movie would have been even better as a mocumentary. But, I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahlberg continues to demonstrate his talent, as he plays with believability an ordinary guy whose biggest dream comes true. He does it with the wonder and innocence that make you not only believe him, but also make you really care about his character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer Aniston, who hasn&#39;t impressed me in movies up to this point, is surprisingly good as the girlfriend/manager. She shows more real emotion than I&#39;ve seen in her last few movies combined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But above all, it&#39;s the music in this movie that really draws you in. Peppered with some 80&#39;s tunes (let&#39;s face it - Bon Jovi would have any 80&#39;s music fans rocking in their seat), the movie really rocks with the original Steel Dragon songs and Wahlberg&#39;s performance of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to see this movie again, but first I&#39;m going to rush out and buy the soundtrack!&#34;
b&#34;What could ever happen in a dull Texan town in summer? Well, a bunch of teenagers find out a few things can and do happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out the Mexican werewolf of this story is nothing less than el chupacabra, and the movie, unlike the name would suggest, is not a remake or lookalike of the American Werewolf movies, but something completely different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for an obviously low-budget movie, it&#39;s not bad! Some clever camera work, quite decent looking traditional creature and gore effects, and for once not all-knowing people that can and do make mistakes, like shooting a colleague thinking it&#39;s the big bad beast, and are baffled by things they could not possibly know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sit down at this expecting a blockbuster million-dollar production, and you will turn it off in disgust after a short while. Sit down at this expecting a bit of entertainment and a relatively simple story, and it&#39;s quite good! Overall it gets an 8/10 from me for being creative, having OK acting, and pulling off some good work for the budget this movie had.&#34;
b&#39;Anthony Quinn is a master at capturing our heart and sympathy. He portrays a Romanian peasant with a below average IQ, harassed by his wife to do more. It\&#39;s WWII and the Nazis have taken over his country. Soon he finds himself digging entrenchments hoping to benefit himself in his wife\&#39;s eyes. The Nazis have different ideas. Through the next years we watch events unfold through his naive eyes, but all he wants to do is go home. His manipulations and ill luck just get him in further hot water. Finally, through no fault of his own, we see his picture on the cover of &#34;Der Spiegel&#34; as the perfect Aryan. The war ends and the allies put him on trial for war crimes. But all our peasant wants to do is return home to his wife.&#39;
b&#39;Definitely a &#34;must see&#34; for all fans of film noir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to a fine script and crisp, razor sharp direction a top cast comes together and works like a well oiled clock to produce a crackerjack psychological thriller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful characterizations articulate the movie\&#39;s powerful message of racial and religious tolerance. It\&#39;s difficult and almost unjust to single out any one particular performance because there isn\&#39;t a weak link in the entire company but Robert Ryan as the hateful and violent white supremacist is truly spine chilling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making this film in the 1940s would have taken a lot of courage. Now,all these years later, at a time when contemporary movies are dominated by a ridiculous over abundance of foul language, bare breasts, crummy acting and deafening soundtracks it\&#39;s refreshing to get back to the basics of quality film making with a viewing treat like &#34;Crossfire&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another low budget gem from the Hollywood archives .&#39;
b&#34;Although perhaps not as entertaining as some of Herzog&#39;s work, Little Dieter is another fine film by one of the world&#39;s greatest film artists. Departing from Herzog&#39;s usual themes, Little Dieter is a fascinating and uplifting character study about a brave man and his efforts to go on living after a life-alteringly traumatic experience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dieter Dengler wanted to fly from a very young age, and the Viet Nam war gave him that opportunity, but instead of spending the war soaring in a cockpit, he spent most of it grounded as a POW. Dieter tells most of his story eloquently and passionately, with occasional help from Herzog. Herzog does very little voice over this time, but contributes a lot of subtly powerful soundscaping and visuals - which should be no surprise to those familiar with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dengler is a fascinating and extremely likable person. As human and as alive as they come, I found the story of his life and his incorrigibly upbeat personality to be inspiring. Thanks to Herzog for (re)introducing him to us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scale of the film is not as sprawling, and the drama is not as fierce as many of the early films that made Herzog a force to be reckoned with. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this to his fans and to those who enjoy documentaries. It&#39;s a very interesting and well executed film.&#34;
b&#39;I will freely admit that I haven\&#39;t seen the original movie, but I\&#39;ve read the play, so I\&#39;ve some background with the &#34;original.&#34; If you shuck off the fact that this is a remake of an old classic, this movie is smart, witty, fresh, and hilarious. Yes, the casting decisions may seem strange, but they WORK. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m a staunch feminist, and I wasn\&#39;t offended in the slightest by this movie--despite what other women might be saying. This is NOT a movie for men to see (so please, ladies, don\&#39;t drag your guys to see it with you, that\&#39;s just cruel); women will get the jokes, the situations, and the relationships. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by the depth that Annette Bening brought to her character...she did an excellent job. Debra Messing was adorable, and Candice Bergen was fantastic. I was less impressed by Meg Ryan...she brought emotion to the table, but her comedic take on it was less strong. The all-female cast is strong, and it definitely a laugh-out-loud sort of comedy. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and fully intend to go see it again with my mother. Women will understand.&#39;
b&#39;I honestly don\&#39;t know what words IMDB will allow me to use in this review, as a result, I\&#39;m having a hard time describing these shorts. Let\&#39;s just say there\&#39;s a good amount of gay sex, some necrophilia, some incest, a fair amount of masturbation, and several artificial.... members. And I loved every minute of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that it\&#39;s ALL crude humor. It isn\&#39;t. They stray away from fart gags for the most part, with the exception of one sketch entitled &#34;Pizza&#34; in which they use one very well. &#34;They&#34; being 3/11ths of the short-lived sketch comedy group that aired on MTV called The State, namely David Wain, Michael Showalter, and Michael Ian Black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trio go on adventures, usually playing themselves and encounter strange and unusual people, people that are often actually more normal than they are. The supporting cast is fantastic as well. Paul Rudd, Julie Bowen, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, and Sam Rockwell all make appearances in various sketches. They\&#39;re also joined by other The State alums like Joe Lo Truglio and Todd Holoubek. The musical selections are also very well placed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;ve enjoyed these sketches over and over again, but they aren\&#39;t for everybody as they\&#39;re pretty vulgar most of the time. If you like clever humor that isn\&#39;t afraid to push the limits of good taste, then I highly recommend this. If you liked Wet Hot American Summer (Directed and written by Wain and Showalter) or The State, then you should really enjoy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it can currently only be ordered online. Check out their website and stream a couple of sketches to get an idea if you really want this first, and then find out how to buy the DVD.&#39;
b&#39;BBC\&#39;s 3 hour adaptation of the novel by Sarah Waters...&#34;Fingersmith&#34;. Life is tough without money, especially in Dickensian London. Dark deeds lead to despicable dilemmas.Is love really just a luxury for the rich and free ?? Elaine Cassidy as &#34;Maud Lilly&#34; and Sally Hawkins as &#34;Sue Trinder&#34; both give fantastic performances as the leading ladies asking this question ... OF EACH OTHER ...whilst Rupert Evans shines as the delightfully bad &#34;Gentleman&#34;.. with great support from Imelda Staunton\&#39;s &#34;Mrs Sucksby&#34;, David Troughton\&#39;s &#34;Mr Ibbs&#34; and Charles Dance\&#39;s &#34;Uncle&#34;. The plot twists and turns and I wasn\&#39;t sure I could be led to care about characters able to hurt and use each other in this way... but somehow.. i do care... and thats because of the quality of the performances... love feels like love .. hate feels like hate... betrayal .. confusion.. well hopefully you get the idea and hopefully you will get the DVD and enjoy.( Elaine Cassidy is just great in this.. gorgeous in fact.... i have to declare i am in her fan club... Hi Elaine : )&#39;
b&#39;The decline series is amazing and director PS can\&#39;t get enough credit for making these movies. I\&#39;m slightly surprised to see that not very many people have seen this one, or the other two, but their worth unearthing if you want the picture of punk in the trans-formative years between the late seventies and early eighties. The film starts out with a blistering collection of clips played over music from the band X. Many interviews with bands and punker\&#39;s that offer an enlightening perspective as to what surviving was like on the low rung of the mainstream rock ladder. No internet, crappy jobs, and all out hostility collide in this genre. For new kids who haven\&#39;t heard of these bands or are just starting one themselves this movie is a true lesson in how to rock. All the band performances (and there are many) are awesome, especially FEAR who never cease to amaze me. This and the second installment are amazing time capsules offering those who care a rare glimpse into the lives of these crazy people. It\&#39;s true punk, like in the interview with Darby Crash\&#39;s girlfriend when their recalling a painter who mysteriously/suddenly died outside their house and it took a week or so for them to figure it out, they take pictures next to the guy and everyone including the EMT\&#39;s had a chuckle on this one, and in true form the interviewer asks the girlfriend if she was sad or upset that this guy had died while painting their house, the response &#34;no i hate painters&#34;. How about Black Flag renting their apartment/rehearsal space for 16 dollars a month! My jaw almost fell off at that moment seeing as i\&#39;m renting a ten by ten closet to practice in for 400. Between watching this and Deadwood i feel like i was born in the wrong time period, just missing those cowboy days and nights of the old way. The people and bands associated with the movie paved the way for what harder music today is, and they did it in their own unique way. Brilliant film, ten stars, see part 2 as well its equally awesome, part 3 though, i don\&#39;t know what to say about.&#39;
b&#39;They are hunted and starving. They are completely demoralized and yet they press on through sheer inertia. This film tries to answer the question &#34;How far will human beings go to survive?&#34; Hopelessness emanates from every of this film and like so many japanese films of this time, it condemns the blind military loyalty that pressed the japanese people into war.&#39;
b&#39;I seriously don\xc2\xb4t know why this movie got such a hostile reception when it was first released. Sure, it\xc2\xb4s overlong and somewhat gratuitous in its depictions of sexuality and violence but so are lots of well regarded movies. I seriously don\xc2\xb4t think that the people who hated &#34;Heaven\xc2\xb4s Gate&#34; really understood it. &#34;Heaven\xc2\xb4s Gate&#34; in its uncut form, much like &#34;The Deer Hunter&#34; shows the gross differences of living an insecure and dangerous life (like the immigrants and Averil in Wyoming) and living in comfort and privilege (like the settled &#34;Americans&#34; in Wyoming and Averil in the prologue and epilogue). Living a hard life is painful but it can also be invigorating as opposed to the dull life Averil leads in the epilogue. Also, as Michael Cimino took great pains to make the picture historically accurate , it is fascinating as a document of (and maybe indictment of) American life in Old West Wyoming. The dialogue is often genuinely clever and emotional. Combined with great music and cinematography, the movie works like a truly poetic work of art. Granted, &#34;Heaven\xc2\xb4s Gate&#34;, with its refusal to patronize the viewer, is not for all tastes. However, Hollywood turns out so much commercial dreck each year which is so much easier to dismiss as mindless eye candy (even when an example of it becomes a blockbuster) that &#34;Gate&#34; and Cimino really do deserve more respect. All people should see the uncut version at least once and then they should make up their own mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;
b&#39;Combining the conventions of both Western and Gothic horror, and often directed as if it were an art movie, this is one of Siegel and Eastwood\&#39;s best collaborations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eastwood plays a Yankee soldier who, after being wounded during the Civil War, takes refuge in an isolated Southern seminary for young women. Shut away from the world, the women project their romantic fantasies on to him, and he responds with callous, male manipulation. But jealousy and resentment raise their heads, and he finds himself in a world of brutal revenge. And boy is the revenge brutal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully shot by Bruce Surtees, and carefully paced, &#34;The Beguiled&#34; is a haunting, elegant work that seems to have influenced the troubled sexuality of Eastwood\&#39;s own &#34;Play Misty for Me&#34; and &#34;Tightrope&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is a gripping depiction of a fierce battle of the sexes and oozes a dreamlike mix of horror and sexuality. All the characters are ambiguous, displaying traits of both good and evil, leaving it up to us to choose whom we should root for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Siegel left quite a legacy of fine films behind. Everything from &#34;Invation of the Body Snatchers&#34; to &#34;Dirty Harry&#34;. But though his early black and white pictures have aged well, the majority of his colour films seem grainy, dated and badly shot. His gritty &#34;realism&#34; must have seemed fresh and kinetic 40 years ago, but when viewed today, I just don\&#39;t think they\&#39;ve stood the test of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The Beguiled&#34;, however, is in a different league. Mature, ambiguous and starkly shot, it\&#39;s a shame it isn\&#39;t more widely known. While evolving technology and technique have rendered the majority of Siegel\&#39;s tough, masculine action thrillers obsolete, &#34;The Beguiled&#34; still entrances audiences today due to it\&#39;s surreal atmosphere and unique subject matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.5/10 - Better than the similarly themed &#34;Black Narcissus&#34;, this is, in my opinion, Siegel\&#39;s best film. Part horror, part drama, part sexual odyssey, &#34;The Beguiled&#34; is a surprisingly arty film (especially when considering that Siegel viewed his films to be, quote, \&#39;meaningless\&#39;). A large part of the film\&#39;s artistry is due to Clint Eastwood, who would, from this point onwards, make an effort to choose mature material.&#39;
b&#34;`Manna From Heaven&#39; is a delightfully compelling film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the shifting paradox of values in middle-class Americans from 40 years ago to the present day, the plot tweaks the concerns and hopes of an interesting range of `Damon Runyonesque&#39; characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their struggles with moral dilemmas, dotting on `what might have been,&#39; hopes to yet fulfill youthful dreams, romantic yearnings, and `hit it big&#39; combine to make a most entertaining film. Rather than relying upon `in-your- face&#39; sexual explicitness, the burgeoning relationship between Inez and Mac/Bake is classically subtle but clear. His untying the knot in her shoelace at the Art Gallery and their heat in their poker game is outstanding&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The script&#39;s crisp writing is skillfully interpreted by an outstanding star and supporting cast. One of the few films I have ever fone to see twice in its opening run, `Manna From Heaven&#39; definitely warrants national distribution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conrad F. Toepfer&#34;
b&#39;I saw this movie on late night TV out of Buffalo about 30 years ago and I\&#39;m dying to see it again one more time before I... well.. you know. The interaction between the main characters after the Tiger (Eli Wallach) &#34;captures&#34; his prey (Anne Jackson) in a botched kidnapping attempt is absolutely hilarious. Charles Nelson Reilly\&#39;s portrayal of a neurotic university dean(?) or department head is priceless. How many films can you name which are able to illuminate humanity\&#39;s struggle for meaning and fulfillment by making you laugh from beginning to end? This film reminds us that we are all in that same struggle regardless of class, race, sex or religion. And who can forget the scene of the suburban homeowner on his hands and knees attacking those few tiny weeds that have dared to appear overnight on his perfectly manicure lawn!&#39;
b&#39;FBI Agents Mulder and Scully get assigned to probe the mystery of what happened to an Arctic drilling team, in this early \&#39;X-Files\&#39; episode that David Duchovny himself considers one of their first &#34;rockin\&#39;&#34; episodes. It pays loving homage to the much lauded John Carpenter 1982 theatrical feature &#34;The Thing&#34;, and one can see the similarities. Visually, color and lighting schemes combine to give the story a hellish quality. Production design / art direction are especially impressive; the shots of the exterior of the Arctic camp are so reminiscent of the earlier film as to automatically create feelings of deja vu for some viewers. Naturally, our heroes are threatened by the weather, so the sound design, involving wind, evokes memories of &#34;The Thing&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The culprit is an ancient worm that had been exposed to the team; once inside a host, it stimulates aggressive behavior. This allows the paranoia aspect to take full hold, and the way the script is set up we can\&#39;t be too sure of who\&#39;s infected and who\&#39;s not. This gives rise to the inevitable scene of testing. This episode certainly works at portraying the way that tensions can cause breakdowns in groups. It even allows Mulder and Scully to have moments where they\&#39;re not sure if they can trust each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guest starring are a good small group of actors: Xander Berkeley, Felicity Huffman, and Steve Hytner as the scientists obliged to accompany Mulder and Scully on the mission, and Jeff Kober as the pilot who takes them to the camp. You can also see one time Jason Voorhees portrayer Ken Kirzinger as one of the ill-fated original team members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, there\&#39;s one direct link between \&#39;Ice\&#39; and &#34;The Thing&#34;: art director Graeme Murray, who worked on both projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/10&#39;
b&#34;exquisite!! in simple words... both Aparna Sen and Konkona Sen seem to understand each other quite well or maybe they both are just too good.this might just be her best performance as an actor and Aparna&#39;s best as a director. yeah maybe better than Mr and Mrs Iyer. Konkona plays the role of a schizophrenic. Shabana Azmi plays the role of Anjali,Mithi&#39;s(Konkona Sen&#39;s) elder sister. Shabana Azmi made the best out of Anjali&#39;s character for she had to play a strong,responsible,arrogant role of an elder sister who had the full responsibility of her family. Aparna Sen has beautifully crafted Anjali&#39;s character,a strong woman who had to sacrifice her personal life,her love for her family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mithi&#39;s behavior was&#39;not juvenile at all,for you can expect this from most of Indian directors for this role.looks like a lot of research has been done to understand the role of Mithi,a schizophrenic. When at times Mithi is a normal,sweet college going girl,she also scares you when she is shown ill..both the sides have been beautifully judged and played..believe me it at times reminds you of the girl in Exorcist..not that scary though.. Overall..Marvellous piece of work by Aparna Sen,Konkona Sen and Shabana Azmi...&#34;
b&#39;Based on the memoirs of Gypsy Rose Lee, who painted a much more affectionate picture of their mother than did her sister, actress &#34;Baby&#34; June Havoc, in her autobiography, &#34;Early Havoc&#34; on which &#34;They Shoot Horses, Don\&#39;t They?&#34; was loosely based. I saw Ethyl Merman in the original Broadway production of Gypsy, and she was great as &#34;Mama Rose&#34; but certainly more &#34;Merman&#34; than Rose. I was disappointed with Rosalind Russell\&#39;s portrayal in the 1962 movie version. An otherwise excellent actress, Russell was a very wooden substitute for Merman. Bette Midler, by contrast, was better and more believable than Merman and I\&#39;d recommend her performance as the definitive one.&#39;
b&#39;&#34;Four Daughters&#34; begins as just another clone of &#34;Little Women&#34; type melodrama. A single father with four musically talented eligible daughters has his hands full trying to keep them in line and guide them in their courting rituals. What turns the film around is the sudden appearance of a new Hollywood star, some critics say the first anti-hero long before James Dean graced the big screen. From the time the dark, foreboding figure of Mickey Borden (John Garfield) appears at Ann Lemp\&#39;s (Priscilla Lane) gate splashing his self-pity and doomed philosophy on the rest of the cast, &#34;Four Daughters&#34; becomes much more than just a chick flick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though Garfield is the main reason to watch &#34;Four Daughters,&#34; there are other flashes of brilliance to enjoy. Hungarian-born director Michael Curtiz, later responsible for such gems as &#34;Casablanca&#34; and &#34;Mildred Pierce,&#34; pinpoints certain images with his camera (aided by cinematographer Ernest Haller of &#34;Rebel Without A Cause&#34; fame) that sticks in the viewers mind, for example the screeching gate that Ann\&#39;s first suitor, Felix Deitz (Jeffrey Lynn), swings on so merrily becomes symbolic of the shifts in moods and affections by those who use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That Garfield delivers the standout performance is obvious, but the rest of the cast keeps up with him most of the way. The underrated Jeffrey Lynn plays his role to perfection, as the neglected suitor whose love for his cherished Ann never falters even when she\&#39;s with another man. Claude Rains, somewhat miscast as the father of the four coming-of-age young women, gives a fine portrayal of a set upon doting family head who gets lost in the shuffle. The three Lane Sisters, already famous for their musical abilities, turn into accomplished actresses, playing their parts well. A raft of supporting actors, including Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, May Robson, and Eddie Acuff, makes it all believable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How opposites attract is part of the ploy for touching the quick of the viewer\&#39;s imagination. Ann is the eternal optimist, even when she and Mickey are down and out. She always looks on the bright side and like so many caught in the pliers of the Great Depression in those days, she saw prosperity just around the corner. Mickey recites an entire list of bad things that have happened to him seeking company in his misery from Ann, which Ann refuses to do. Mickey expects to go out with a bolt of lightning striking him dead as he rounds the corner of life. Mickey has meager talent as a composer; Ann has talent to spare as a singer and musician. Ann is big on beauty; Mickey is big on personality in a warped sense of a way. And the differences go on and on. How all this is reconciled in the end is an important part of the movie, not to be missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See &#34;Four Daughters&#34; for John Garfield\&#39;s doozy of an acting debut on the big screen. The only time he was better came seven years later when he again mesmerized the film goers with one of the greatest screen performances ever, as Frank Chambers in &#34;The Postman Always Rings Twice,&#34; opposite the equally charismatic Lana Turner. But also watch &#34;Four Daughters&#34; to catch important elements that may be missed if too much concentration is placed on the star of the show.&#39;
b&#34;I hope Robert Redford continues to make more films like this. Hillerman&#39;s books are wonderful, and as a young child raised in the Southwest his stories hit home! Adam Beach is a highly under rated and under used actor. Wake up Hollywood, not everyone thinks that your Mel Gibson&#39;s are cool! Many movie goer&#39;s today want to see films that make you think. I have seen all of the Redford/Hillerman series. They are thoughtful, scenic and have great plots. I&#39;m hoping that if enough people write to Robert Redford he may decide to make a few more! Thank you Adam Beach and Tony Hillerman for great entertainment! If anyone get&#39;s a chance to read Tony Hillerman&#39;s latest book do so! It&#39;s great. I also recommend traveling through Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado. Stop at every view site and feel the setting of Hillerman&#39;s books. Amazing experience.&#34;
b&#39;This film was hilarious. It provided a somewhat comical view of the British club scene, which, if you really look at it, is a funny thing. The characters in this flick were so realistic to those of us who watched here at my place that it was like watching a movie about ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a few pivotal scenes which really made this movie work: the getting ready scenes; the &#34;Get me a real doctor&#34; scene; the white background scene showing each character in a total state of being wrecked, ending with the infamous line &#34;what was i saying?&#34; and the comedown-sunup scenes. I have lived these moments myself and found myself laughing hysterically at my own ridiculous behaviour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can\&#39;t give this movie a 10 because it doesn\&#39;t measure up to Groove, which I thought was out of this world, but it certainly has its moments. The mise-en-scene and the camera work is superb, the special effects are well worth mentioning, and the acting is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After waiting a long time to see this film, I am glad to say that I was not disappointed. I hope to see more from the writer/director in the future.&#39;
b&#34;I had the good fortune to be at Perris Island in the fall of 1959. The DI showed one evening at the outdoor theater directly in front of our barracks, Plt 162, B Co, 1st Bn, 1st ITR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although we hadn&#39;t been there long enough to even think about seeing a movie, we could hear those that were laughing. It&#39;s one of the many indelible memories of my thirteen weeks at PI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At some later date, I got to actually see it in a theater. I&#39;m still convinced that, to date, it remains the most realistic portrayal of the experience in the late 1950&#39;s ever done. No one has done it better than Jack Webb...&#34;
b&#34;I thought that this movie was incredible. I absolutely loved it, even though my brothers didn&#39;t that much. The special effects were outstanding, and this movie is about my favorite sport; golf. The only thing that was disappointing about this amazing movie is that it is hard to watch two times or more in a row. This movie just absolutely tops everything else I have ever seen. It was everything I would expect out of a movie. I just loved it. Also, it was pretty kid-friendly. This movie helped me realize that when you put your mind to it, anything is possible. I would give it a pure 10/10! It was better than The Legend of Baggar Vants, and the two Pirates of the Caribbean movies combined. Absolutely amazing. Loved it.&#34;
b&#34;Running Out of Time is probably as close to a perfect film as you&#39;re ever likely to see out of Hong Kong. All the elements click: a terrific script (by French writers Julien Carbon and Laurent Courtiaud) that even manages to subvert the odd clich\xc3\xa9, reliably imaginative direction by Johnnie To, and excellent central performances by Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan, the latter displaying his great comic timing to wonderful effect without ever crossing the line into parody (especially in his exasperated reactions to his superior&#39;s abysmal negotiating skills). The supporting cast is fine too, with Yo Yo Mung making a strong impression in a tiny role, and even the often histrionic Waise Lee (looking remarkably, and very aptly, like a bald Andy Lau) reining it in to good effect. It&#39;s best not to know too much about the plot going in beyond the basic set-up \xc2\x96 with only a few weeks to live, Lau engages in a criminal game with Wan&#39;s cop with no easily apparent motive \xc2\x96 and just sit back and enjoy the ride: it&#39;s certainly worth the fare. It also has one of the most perfect love stories in recent movies, and played in a mere three scenes (the second bus ride is one of the most magical moments of film-making I&#39;ve seen in ages). There&#39;s also a fine score by Raymond Wong as well. The most fun playing cat and mouse at the movies in years.&#34;
b&#39;People who thought that THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK sucked harder than the black hole that swallowed up EVENT HORIZON, probably didn\&#39;t see the movie that spawned Vin Diesel\&#39;s skin-headed killer to begin with, and probably have no intention of doing so. Too bad, because PITCH BLACK actually does kick major ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directed by genre vet David Twohy, (WARLOCK and the excellent but underrated BELOW) and written by siblings Jim and Ken Wheat (LIES, SILENT SCREAM), PITCH BLACK begins with an \&#39;ALIEN\&#39;-esque prologue. When a combination cargo freighter/passenger ship is badly damaged by a freak meteor shower (in which the captain is also killed), the co-pilot, Carolyn Fry (SILENT HILL\&#39;S Radha Mitchell) has an important decision to make: ditch the cargo or the passengers? Close to picking ore over occupants, the crash landing derails her ultimate course of action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter, because the catastrophic landing has been made on a foreboding rock that once held a mining colony. Amongst the survivors are a couple of settlers, Shazza (FARSCAPE\&#39;s Claudia Black) and Zeke (John Moore); an Imam (Keith David) and his young followers (can you say &#34;red shirts&#34; boys and girls?); an antiques dealer named Paris Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald); a \&#39;young boy\&#39; named Jack (Rhianna Griffith), and the most controversial members of the group: a Marshall named Johns (the excellently slimy Cole Hauser) and his prisoner...a dangerous murderer named Riddick (Diesel). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How the group dynamics shake out make for a lot of the dramatic tension, especially with concerns about Riddick and how many people he might slice and dice if he ever gets away. But no one here gets out alive, as the saying goes, and the biggest twists have less to do with how they get along, than how they\&#39;ll survive when they discover the unthinkable. They are not alone on the planetoid. Things that are hungry, taloned and quick are slithering around just where they can\&#39;t be seen, living in the darkness where they can survive and thrive. They want the flesh of the new arrivals to sate their appetites, but they can\&#39;t come out into the searing daylight to forage for food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the phrase &#34;total eclipse&#34; make things a little more interesting? You betcha. Hence the more-than-fitting title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vin, more monosyllabic than Clint Eastwood\&#39;s Dirty Harry on his grumpiest day, dripping more testosterone than sweat, has a field day here with a character that really does seem worth a sequel or two, and Hauser, oozing menace and bile is every bit as good as his dad Wings was at on-screen villainy. Surprisingly, though, Mitchell holds her own and manages to be strong and sympathetic as Fry. You would expect no less than a strong showing from Black, She Who Once Was \&#39;Aeryn Sun\&#39;, and she doesn\&#39;t disappoint. (Too bad her role wasn\&#39;t bigger, but that\&#39;s all I\&#39;ll say about it.) And David makes his usual indelible impression as the holy man whose faith will truly be tested in the very pit of Hell itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pace moves faster than Riddick slipping up behind his prey with a shank in his teeth, and once the darkness descends, the terror and tension never let up, pretty much as in other classic sci-fi/horror flicks which this imitates. But if imitation truly is the sincerest form of flattery, Dave Twohy and the Wheats deserve major backslaps for getting this one right with a vengeance, and for giving us an ending that is anti-Hollywood to the max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t want to spoil the surprises, so I won\&#39;t say much more, except that if you saw CHRONICLES first and weren\&#39;t too happy, give PITCH BLACK a chance anyway. And if you\&#39;ve seen neither, definitely start with this one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t know what Vin is up to now, but he could certainly do worse than to give these guys a call again. I\&#39;d love to see what they would dream up next...&#39;
b&#39;Once you sit down to see this film &#34; A Cannon for Cordoba &#34; you get the feeling it\&#39;s going to be a great. The reason? The film begins with a rousing score by noted composer Elmer Bernstein who gave us such memorable themes as \&#39;The Great Escape and the Magnificent Seven.\&#39; Indeed, when you read the opening credits headlining the cast is none other than George Peppard as Capt. Rod Douglas, you know it\&#39;s going to have action and lot\&#39;s of it. Furthermore when you see actor John Russel playing General John J. Pershing, you know you\&#39;re in for a heroic saga. The story is taken from the annals of the Mexican revolution and involves the U.S. in a border town dispute with the Mexican bandits who cross the Rio Grande in the early 1900s. Among the most brazen of the rebel leaders is General Cordova (Raf Vallone). With his army of Mexican revolutionaries, he attacks Pershing, kills his men and steals some valuable artillery pieces. Since the United States Army cannot enter Mexico legally, Capt. Douglas is sent on what is slated a suicide mission, without orders and without aid from Pershing. His mission is to retrieve the Cannons, destroy a rebel stronghold and bring Cordova back alive. Selecting the roughest, toughest, most experienced, certainly the most insolent men available, Douglas enters Mexico and attacks the nearly impregnable fortress. Dramatic action follows, as does lots of explosive excitement. If one is asks for criticism, I would say the choice of heavies. Vallone and John Larch are not very menacing. Not so with the men who side with Peppard. Pete Duel and Don Gordon (Who is superb.) Nevertheless, this movie is recommended as good viewing. ****&#39;
b&#34;I remember when skateboarding had it&#39;s rebirth in the 70s. I begged my parents for money to by a second-hand skateboard from a friend. It was a piece of junk, complete with clay wheels and everything. I also remember reading Skateboarder Magazine and being both completely impressed and totally terrified of the Dogtown crew. Skating never became a way of life for me, but in some ways it has always been a part of my life, whether it is using a board for transportation or just having a bunch of friends that skate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is a brilliant documentary of the real birth of modern day skating. Watching this crew turn skating from the flat boring hobby it was into the vertical lifestyle it has become had me sitting slack-jawed for 90 minutes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s amazing that enough footage from this period still exists to have created this film, and thank god for that. The footage is brilliant. It gave me the feeling of watching an old Buster Keaton film: I&#39;ve seen some of the tricks Keaton did repeated countless times in other films since then, but when you go back and see the first person to perform that trick it&#39;s amazing that, not only were they the first person to try it successfully, but that they lived through it and made it seem effortless. That&#39;s the feeling this film gave me. Yeah, I&#39;ve seen people skate pools before, but to watch the FIRST people skating pools and inventing the tricks that eventually became the basics of modern skating is like watching the facade of the house fall on Keaton, leaving him standing safely in the frame of a window. It&#39;s absolutely brilliant to watch something that, up until that point, had never been tried before, but since, has been tried by almost everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is beautiful to watch and incredible to listen to. The soundtrack is one of the best I&#39;ve ever heard in a film. This is a film that will appeal to people whether they like skating or not. I&#39;ve talked to a couple of friends of mine who made their girlfriends sit through this film after heavy protest, and they all said that their girlfriends were mesmerized by the end of the film and loved it as much as they did. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the previous comments on this board that complain about the film being too self congratulatory, I think that&#39;s an unfair disparagement. I liked seeing these guys get excited about their past. They created something that influenced their sport and changed it forever. They have the right to pat themselves on the back. They were stars for doing what they loved to do. Most of these guys/girls never achieved the staggering success Tony Hawk enjoys today, but that kind of success wasn&#39;t available to skaters then. Sure, they had some success, but more importantly, they have been able to live a life doing what they love to do, and, as we see in the end, almost all of them still surf, skate or work in the surf/skate industry. How many of us can say that we have been able to live our lives and have been successful by breaking all the rules and doing what we love to do? They can. My hat&#39;s off to the Dogtown and Z-Boys for being themselves and changing the world of skateboarding forever.&#34;
b&#34;Meester Sharky, you look so ... normal. You would never get a table in this fancy cocktail restaurant/bistro. I, on the other &#39;and eat grapes and pate &#39;ere every day. You like my fur coat with all the fine trimming? My enormous golden rings of gold? Or maybe you like these blonde, &#39;ow you say?, bombshells, who are all qualified in aerobics and naked petanques, who decorate my long, maroon velvety sofa like so many soft boiled larks on a plate of pan fried foie gras and figs. You like? You can&#39;t have! Zey are all mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will never possess &#39;er as I possessed &#39;er. Domino was the best, apart from Maman. You do not understand the art of lovemaking. Just look at your inferior moustache. It is almost funny to me, non, to think of that ludicrous protuberance on your silly face, as you snuffle around Domino&#39;s love hillock like the piggy seeking the truffle in the forest, the forest heaving and swaying in the hot winds of desire! You lose again Sharky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I make love to the women zey know, Sharky, zey know. Zey learn, zey learn until zey become the teacher. Not nano-maths, the arts of love. Domino was the seedling which I watered. I watered her so very often. Everywhere Sharky. Her scented petals, her proud stalk, everywhere. She will wither under your ridiculous hose, like the souffl\xc3\xa9 removed from the oven five minute too soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must go now Sharky, you bore me so with your disgraceful behaviour. It is you who will be flushed down le pissoir like the smelly thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bon chance!&#34;
b&#34;I don&#39;t see why all the people are giving this film negative reviews?!?! I loved this movie! Bled is a form of abstract art, and if you don&#39;t appreciate art, I can see why you would not like this film. It was a great twist from the average, played out vampire movie. If you are looking for a fresh, new and ingenious new vampire movie, then this is for you. But if you want one of those turn into bats, wolves and melt in the sunlight movies, then go watch your old played out Dracula flicks. Sure, it is a bit on the low budget side, but they did a great job with the budget they had. I&#39;m very happy that I found this movie, because I was about to give up on the vampire genre fro good. I thought this film was brilliant! I give 2 thumbs up to the writer, director and everyone involved in the film.&#34;
b&#34;Soul Calibur has always been my favorite fighting game series of all time. And SCIII is my favorite one of the series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The graphics are very well done. Much bigger improvement over the choppy polygons in Soul Edge/Soul Blade. The characters have facial expressions, hair blows in the breeze and they even blink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soul Calibur has always been known for it&#39;s interesting plots and characters and SCIII is no exception. Each character has his/her background story that is detailed and well done. My favorite character is Chai Xianghua. She&#39;s cute, she&#39;s funny and she&#39;s a strong female character. Yeah, I know she wears pink and has a boyfriend (who she ends up saving BTW), but there seems to be more to her than that. Xianghua, like all the other characters, have flaws and upsides to their personalities, so no character is perfect, not even the good guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The music is beautifully composed for a fighting game series. It doesn&#39;t sound kitchy (the Vampire series) nor does it sound like old school porn film soundtrack (Mortal Kombat). The characters have their own themes and a lot of the themes are done to match the culture of that certain part of the world. I don&#39;t think there is a song on this soundtrack I don&#39;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another cool thing about this game is to create your own anime-like character (Create a Soul). You could make him/her look as cute or as sexy or even ugly if you like. However, if you found a character customization that you like, remember to take notes, or else you won&#39;t remember how you created that character. I found myself being very addicted to CaS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think Soul Calibur is my number one fighting game series of all time. It has everything I asked for. What more could I want?&#34;
b&#39;OK. Is Barney the best children\&#39;s show of all time? Of course not. But in some of the comments left by other members of IMDb you would think it was a multi million dollar production with high class actors and a ridiculous budget for special effects. Well guess what? It\&#39;s Barney for God\&#39;s sake. He shows children good behavior, good manors and that it\&#39;s OK to be who you are. For those of you who find him annoying that is because you are not five years old and the show was not meant for you. To the IMDb member who wrote the review on the first page I think you may have gone a little too far. Did you actually describe a Sesame Street character as &#34;down to Earth&#34;? Grow up everyone, this is a great show for preschoolers and actually does help children learn in a fun and creative way.&#39;
b&#34;Edith Nesbitt&#39;s best book has been adapted into a truly magnificent film, I love it. The film itself has gorgeous cinematography, and fine realisation of the subject matter. The ending is enough to have you in tears, as it is so beautifully done. Lionel has directed some truly excellent films, like the Amazing Mr Blunden, but this is his best film as director by a mile. The costumes were absolutely lovely, that matched the beauty of the countryside, and the sparkling and conveniently-faithful script helped matters. However, it is the quality of the acting that holds this film together, as it is nothing shorter than incredible. Dinah Sheridan is suitably sincere as the mother, a much-needed characteristic of the character, and Bernard Cribbins was hilarious as Perks. In fact, I preferred Perks on film, as he isn&#39;t as humorous in the book. The children were perfect. Gary Warren and Sally Thomsett both gave spirited performances, but it is Jenny Agutter&#39;s enchanting portrayal of Bobbie that impressed me the most. Another special mention is the gorgeous music by Johnny Douglas, the title music reminded me of Charlie Chaplin&#39;s Smile. In conclusion, a funny and poignant masterpiece, that is better than the book, I think. 10/10. Bethany Cox.&#34;
b&#39;Mel Brooks has really outdone himself on this movie. No one can deny that Blazing Saddles was a classic, and a breakthrough in this style of comedy film, but Men In Tights has become the apex of his creative genius. This movie is a definite must-see. If you enjoy this movie, I would also recommend Space Balls and History Of The World. The same goes in reverse. If you have seen any of these movies, then Men In Tights should be next on your list.&#39;
b&#34;There is little more that I would like to say about this movie than it really can touch your heart if you let it. Sure, it&#39;s surrounded by all the stereotypical Hollywood stuff, but I found myself actually engrossed in this movie and very interested in the outcome. I&#39;d recommend it to all you romantics out there in a second!&#34;
b&#34;I have seen this film on 3 different occasions.On the first occasion,I was bowled over by this film.It appeared as a very kind film to me.I hated this film as a sentimental garbage on my second viewing.However my third viewing reasserted my belief that it is a good film.There is a lot of emotional power in this film especially scenes of emotional confrontation between Mr Kramer and Madam Kramer.There are some scenes in which Meryl Streep appears a cruel person despite the fact that she is a beauty in real life.Dustin Hoffman appears as a lost hero unable to grapple with the recent task of his child&#39;s custody.There was even a controversy on the sets of this film.According to the master cameraman Nestor Almendros there was a shot in which he just escaped getting hurt as the character of Mr.Kramer,in order to show the intensity of his anger,decides to break a glass hard.Luckily nothing happened to Nestor.Kramer versus Kramer shows the destruction of a family structure.It also tells how family must be maintained if there are kids involved.&#34;
b&#34;One wonders about the state of a society that produce a father like Albert T. Fitzgerald, who we first meet on a plane, as he is heading toward the place he abandoned a long time ago, and where he left a wife and a child who is now accused of murdering a mentally challenged boy. When we first see him, he has caught a headline in the paper the woman in front of him is reading. Rather rudely, he asks her if he could have the newspaper, and the lady offers other sections. Well, that&#39;s not what he asked, what he wants the woman to do, is to give him the front section she is reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matthew Ryan Hoge wrote and directed this disturbing film that reflects, in many ways, our society as it is today. In fact, Mr. Hoge is pointing out exactly at what is wrong with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film presents Leland, a teen ager who can&#39;t even differentiate between fantasy and reality. It&#39;s evident that killing a human being, even the sweet and innocent boy who hasn&#39;t done anything to deserve it, will have fatal consequences, not only for himself, but for his own family, and the family of the slain boy. In fact, Leland seems to have no idea about what motivated him to commit the crime for he does not show any repentance about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s obvious Leland has been traumatized by his parents divorce. His own father is an aloof man who couldn&#39;t care less about him. It&#39;s Pearl, the teacher in the juvenile detention center who sees the turmoil inside the young man and wants to help, but unfortunately, he doesn&#39;t have a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing in the film is Don Cheadle, a great actor who always delivers. The ensemble cast does good work under Mr. Hoge&#39;s direction. Kevin Spacey has a good opportunity playing the egotistical father of the accused murderer and makes us detest him for being an arrogant idiot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although a bit long, the film leaves us with more questions than what it answered.&#34;
b&#39;If you\&#39;re a &#34;child of the Eighties&#34; like me, you probably remember this 1981 Disney movie--one of Disney\&#39;s first PG-rated films, and Michael J. Fox\&#39;s screen debut. I can remember watching this film over and over on HBO when I was on middle school, and I only recently found a very old copy of it, since Disney stopped producing the movie several years ago. Needless to say, this is a real fun movie to watch. Five college teams decipher clues in an evening race around Los Angeles, trying to reach the finish line first. Watch for the cameo from Paul Reubens. From the cheesy music to the disco scene with the fat twins, this is a quintessential 1980s fun film that you\&#39;ll love.&#39;
b&#34;I see alot of movies at the cinema (103 so far this year) and I have to say that this is by far and away the best film I have seen this year, even though it was released back in 1954!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sat in awe and watched this work of genius and felt quite ashamed that I had never even heard of it before my local art house cinema decided to show it for a week on what looked like a new print. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of the whole movie has to be the 28 minute break in where there is no speech and no music, merely the sound of the men carrying out the heist. Pure quality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although really dark in places it is lightened with the dry humour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not many films score 10 out of 10 but this does and also gets a gold star for effort!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ever get a chance to see this movie, please do not hesitate, it&#39;s a classic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;
b&#34;So it isn&#39;t an epic, but for people experiencing anything similar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(sibling suicide) it might be an interesting way of therapy. An&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;imaginative narrative and some fine acting makes it time well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;spent. For some reason, it hasn&#39;t really caught on in the audience,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;something I do believe is a result of the main theme. Why did she&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;commit suicide? Clearly, this is hardly something that US&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;moviegoers will flock to, had it been an European production it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;probably would have reached its audience in a much greater&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;extent. It is however, a movie that although the realism tainted by a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shimmering romanticized glow, gives the viewer a whole hearted&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;impression.&#34;
b&#34;This is one of the few movies that was recommended to me as absolutely brilliant, that really is. If you give this movie a low note than you really missed the point. You could describe Fosca as manipulative, but what if it is really serious, that she gets ill when the love she is sure of isn&#39;t answered. But what would you do when you are sure that the other one loves you, and is &#39;only&#39; rejected by the fact that you are ugly. Wouldn&#39;t you fight for it. At least I think it is better to fight for it that die in bitterness. And it reminds me of the fact how I, as a man, react at first sight completely on the physical ugliness of Fosca and don&#39;t look further at the person she is or might be. This movie confronts me with very solemn questions about respect, trust, feeling manipulated and so on. How do I now if someone manipulates me or is just trying everything to make contact? What I think to be the most outstanding feature in this movie is that Ettore Scola made it absolutely believable that Giorgio falls in love with Fosca.&#34;
b&#39;This is one you can watch over and over and laugh just as much each time. We have been on a Keaton fest around here after purchasing some of his films. In this one Buster is mistaken for an escaped murderer and there are lots of chase scenes and crazy scenes but also what is best about Buster - his creativity. The opening scene is really funny and it just keeps going from there.&#39;
b&#39;If extreme activities (and I don\&#39;t mean the Hollywood ones like UFC &amp; X-Games) and the people who pursue them interest you then seek this doc out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those truth-is-stranger-than-fiction tales of Donald Crowhurts\&#39;s obsession to prove himself against great odds. Those odds were stacked by Mother Nature, the media and his own mind. It is also about a time lost to us --although it was only 40 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The filmmakers have done a great job in gathering a wide range of material to tell his story and the story of the great race that consumed him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn\&#39;t help but to think about Timothy Treadwell and the Apollo astronauts in the 2 great docs GRIZZLY MAN and IN THE SHADOW OF THE MOON while experiencing --you don\&#39;t simply &#34;watch&#34;-- this story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you live in a big city buy it or rent it. It is worth the effort to find. I had to travel 100 miles to L.A. to buy it and I am glad I did.&#39;
b&#34;I find it sad that just because Edward Norton did not want to be in the film or have anything to do with it, people automatically think the movie sucks without even watching it or giving it a chance. I really hope Norton did not do this. He is a fine actor and all but he scared people away from a decent movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it entertaining. It wasn&#39;t mind blowing or anything with crazy special effects, but it was not a bad. It was fun to watch. But yea, definitely not a bad/horrible movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/10&#34;
b&#34;This film is Engaging and Complex while maintaining simple beauty .Our two characters come together sharing the base of curiosity and loneliness, but it is a springboard for learning these people, they &#39;re life styles and pasts which support this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two lead actors (Bohl, Brundruge) were in the moment as any two actors I have ever seen. %100 believable, they transport the audience seemingly effortlessly, into their world. The actors&#39; seamless acting teamed with Bechard&#39;s Beautiful, realistic dialog and his truthful direction drives the story forward into a striking and moving finale.This film is visual treat- soft ,increasing the intensity of The story. The soundtrack serenades the viewer, soothing yet drawing out the emotional content of the film. I find this project to be nothing short of a masterpiece. intriguing.intense.&#34;
b&#39;Chris Smith is a superior filmmaker with the seldom-seen talent for spotting a good story, then getting the hell out of its way. Smith\&#39;s &#34;American Movie&#34; is the true-to-life record of filmmaker wannabe Mark Borchardt, a loser intent on milking his elderly uncle for cash to complete his horror short. But never, under any circumstances, to pursue gainful employment or support the children he\&#39;s conceived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such is producer Smith\&#39;s skill that Mark appears more sympathetic than otherwise. Even as he entices Uncle Bill with sugar-spun dreams and executive producer credits, it is his desperation to be somebody, to have his name coupled with the likes of Scorsese and Spielberg that touches us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;American Movie&#34; also belongs in that rare, often attempted but seldom achieved sub genre that successfully blends hilarity with horror. The humor comes from Borchardt\&#39;s Ed Wood-style belief in his own genius. From his appalling attempts at acting, from his substituting his less than film-savvy mother for a missing cameraman and from his employing sweet but brain-damaged friend Mike whenever he\&#39;s short an actor or crew member.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The horror comes from seeing what Borchardt cannot: It is this very American attitude--I Want, Therefore I Am Entitled--that keeps him from seeing just how much he has to learn about his chosen craft. He is so confident he can\&#39;t fail that failure is guaranteed.&#39;
b&#34;I happened upon this by chance. I was at my friends house and he had just started watching it, so I sat down thinking we would shoot the breeze whilst this was playing in the background. However, within seconds I was immersed in this docu-drama, and we both spent the rest of the time completely focused on this and not saying a word to each other. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never knew the tale of the the first solo around the world yacht race, let alone the tragic events of one man&#39;s attempt against the odds, which set out to be his redemption for all of his misfortunes in life, but ultimately ends up becoming an example of them. Having not known of the story, I did watch this with the same fervor as I imagine those who were reading about the race at the time it actually was happening, engulfed in what was taking place and eager for more information, hoping the lone amateur was going to pull it off against the odds and beat the pro&#39;s, which makes the shocking twists of the story all the more tragic, I felt like I was living the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is told with great care, and the interviewees have clearly had time to reflect on the tragedy, which gives great insights, but is also contrasted nicely by the archive footage of interviews at the time of the tragedy, the recordings and photographs of the lone sailors is also excellently used, and the insights into the minds of the sailors and how solitude was affecting them was superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m shocked that this story isn&#39;t more widely known or has been turned into a movie, but also thankful. Thankful that we have this drama-documentary to tell the tale from those who knew the man, instead of some wishy-washy movie adaptation, and thankful that I caught this gem of a film by pure chance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a must see, whether you like documentaries or not.&#34;
b&#34;Stanwyck at her villainous best, Robinson her equal - as ruthless land barons in this fairly ordinary western.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some good action scenes, strong use of location, colour and Cinemascope. But why the obvious use of stock footage in the stampede scene?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ford is dependable as always and Foster is strong as Robinson&#39;s daughter, but it is the baddies&#39; film. And it&#39;s not just Stanwyck and Robinson - Brian Keith makes a surprisingly dashing villain as Stanwyck&#39;s lover, and Richard Jaeckel is unforgettable as a cold-hearted killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See it for the camp value.&#34;
b&#39;I really wanted to be able to give this film a 10. I\&#39;ve long thought it was my favorite of the four modern live-action Batman films to date (and maybe it still will be--I have yet to watch the Schumacher films again). I\&#39;m also starting to become concerned about whether I\&#39;m somehow subconsciously being contrarian. You see, I always liked the Schumacher films. As far as I can remember, they were either 9s or 10s to me. But the conventional wisdom is that the two Tim Burton directed films are far superior. I had serious problems with the first Burton Batman this time around--I ended up giving it a 7--and apologize as I might, I just couldn\&#39;t help feel that Batman Returns just has too many small direction, plot and script problems scattered throughout to justify a 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Burton _almost_ trumps the problems with sheer force of style, and even though there are a lot of small flaws, Batman Returns is still a great film, especially if you\&#39;re a Burton fan, as Batman Returns has just as much in common with The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Edward Scissorhands (1990) as it does with anything else in the Batman universe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film begins strongly, with the Cobblepots having a baby. We see their dismay--people walk out of the birthing room with horror on their faces, ready to vomit. Later, they have the baby in a small cage. Finally they take it out for an evening stroll and dump it in the Gotham City River. The baby ends up becoming Batman villain The Penguin (Danny DeVito).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is the film\&#39;s &#34;evil capitalist&#34;, comparable to Grissom (Jack Palance) in Batman. He is planning on duping Gotham City in various ways, and we see him emotionally abusing his secretary, the timid Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). When Kyle discovers one of the nefarious plots, Grissom tries to get rid of her, but she is rescued by cats, becoming Catwoman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While all of this is going on, The Penguin, who has long been only rumored to exist and who is thought to be dangerous, begins a scheme to be presented to the public as a good guy, despite having less than benevolent, ulterior motives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before re-watching Burton\&#39;s Batman films this time, I didn\&#39;t remember just how little the films are about Batman (Michael Keaton). It\&#39;s almost as if Burton didn\&#39;t feel the character was interesting enough to focus on. The focus here is much more on the villains, especially The Penguin. Batman doesn\&#39;t appear very often, especially in the beginning of the film, and surprisingly often, we\&#39;re watching him watching The Penguin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although some viewers necessarily count the above as a flaw, I can\&#39;t say that I do, even if I\&#39;d like to know more about Batman and follow his story more. The villains\&#39; stories are interesting, too, and as an &#34;origin story&#34; for two major Batman villains, Batman Returns is already more than complex in terms of plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are some character problems that I do count as a flaw. The Penguin has a cadre of circus performers who do his bidding, but even though they\&#39;re frequently on screen, we never get to learn anything about them. Burton has a core of characters as intriguing as those in Tod Browning\&#39;s Freaks (1932) available, with actors as interesting as Vincent Schiavelli, but he just doesn\&#39;t have the space to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For that matter, he hardly has space to explore Catwoman. The film plays as if Catwoman may have been as developed and featured in as many scenes as The Penguin, but that cut of the film would have been 4 hours long. So the bulk of the Catwoman scenes had to be excised. Of course, all of this barely leaves any room for Batman. Burton has Batman turn very dark in the public\&#39;s eye in this film, and unusually, he never bothers to resolve this. As far as we know, at the end, Gothamites still think that Batman is a murdering lunatic. That\&#39;s an interesting development, but unfortunately it ended up being dropped between this film and the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the script, although there are minor problems including some non-sequiturs and bizarre decisions (in terms of logic) made by characters, it\&#39;s clear that Burton and writers Sam Hamm and Daniel Waters are not exactly trying to tell a traditional story. A lot of the dialogue is pun-oriented, but often this is fairly subtle and/or complex (of course, sometimes it is very blatant or transparent, too). It helps to look at Batman Returns as a more &#34;poetic&#34; film, as I believe was the intention. This also carries over into more general plot and directorial decisions--plenty of odd character actions, including from minor characters, are done in service of a general mood or style, and that style works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Dark&#34; is the easiest way to sum up Batman Returns in a word, and whether that\&#39;s a positive or negative depends on your disposition. Anyone who knows me knows that I love dark. So for me, Burton\&#39;s style largely transcends the flaws in the plot and the script. In many ways, Batman Returns is like an insane, campy horror film, with beautifully eerie production design. Like Batman, Burton is still making many references to other films, but instead of Vertigo (1958) and Star Wars (1977) (well, there\&#39;s still a slight Star Wars reference), he invokes films like Nosferatu (1922) (including that &#34;Max Schreck&#34; was the name of the actor who played the Dracula-like character there), Motel Hell (1980), the aforementioned Freaks, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) (which has a surreal, dark edge to it) and zombie films--made most explicit in The Penguin\&#39;s final scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of visuals and general atmosphere--and that includes the general &#34;feel&#34; of the story, the characters and so on--this couldn\&#39;t be a stronger 10.&#39;
b&#34;Loved today&#39;s show!!! It was a variety and not solely cooking (which would have been great too). Very stimulating and captivating, always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next. She is as down to earth and as personable as you get, like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable. Special guests, who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too. Loved the &#39;first&#39; theme and that the audience was invited to play along too. I must admit I was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things, but she did it and by golly I&#39;ll be writing those recipes down. Saving time in the kitchen means more time with family. Those who haven&#39;t tuned in yet, find out what channel and the time, I assure you that you won&#39;t be disappointed.&#34;
b&#39;Peter Boyle was always a great actor and he proved it by his performance as a gun-ho Bigot, making me hate him everytime he used the &#34;N&#34; word, I watched him and his big mouth and wanted to punch his lights out. ( Just think, Peter Boyle was a Monk once) (Now a supporting actor in &#34;Everybody Loves Raymond&#34;) Susan Sarandon making her first debut need a bath right away and enjoyed sharing it with someone else in his own dirty water. I noticed a large Raggerty Ann Doll(creator, John Gruelle) was the only thing that Susan could actually trust and love and the doll appeared in quite a few scenes. If you really want to know about the way out 70\&#39;s with drugs, free love and pipe dreams, then, enjoy the excellent direction of John G. Avildsen (&#34;Rocky and &#34;The Karate Kid&#34;) I always thought that Peter Boyle should have been blown away in the end!! This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.&#39;
b&#39;If you wish to see Shakespeare\&#39;s masterpiece in its entirety, I suggest you find this BBC version. Indeed it is overlong at four and a half hours but Jacoby\&#39;s performance as Hamlet and Patrick Stewart\&#39;s as Claudius are well worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It never ceases to amaze me how clear &#34;Hamlet&#34; is when you see it in its length and order as set down by the Bard. Every film version of &#34;Hamlet&#34; has tinkered with its structure. Olivier concentrated on Hamlet\&#39;s indecision, Gibson on his passions. Jacoby is able to pull all of these aspects of Hamlet\&#39;s character together with the aid of Shakespeare\&#39;s full script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why does Hamlet not kill Claudius immediately? Hamlet says &#34;I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious...&#34; Hamlet is extremely upset, not only for his father\&#39;s death (and suspected murder), or his mother\&#39;s marriage to his uncle, but also, and mostly, because Claudius has usurped the throne belonging to Hamlet. He is furious at his mother for marrying Claudius (marriages between royal kin is not unknown; done for political reasons) but that her marriage solidified Claudius\&#39; claim to the throne before he could return from Wittenburg to claim it for himself. He is, therefore, impotent to do anything about it. And this is true even after he hears his father\&#39;s ghost cry vengeance. He cannot simply kill the King or he will lose the throne in doing so. He must &#34;out&#34; the King\&#39;s secret and here is the tragedy! At the moment Hamlet is successful in displaying Claudius\&#39; guilt in public, he has opportunity to kill him and does not. WHY? He wants it ALL! He wants revenge, the throne AND the damnation of Claudius\&#39; soul in hell. Hamlet OVERREACHES himself in classic tragic form. His own HUBRIS is his undoing. He kills Polonius thinking it is Claudius and the rest of the play spirals down to the final deaths of Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Ophelia, Laertes, Gertrude, Claudius and Hamlet himself.&#39;
b&#34;John Landis truly outdid himself when he directed Michael Jackson&#39;s THRILLER as a short film. Of course, it&#39;s corny, the dialogue is terrible and it all seems way too cheesy, but it&#39;s perfect none-the-less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael and his date are out at the cinema to view the latest horror flick. When it all gets a little too graphic for the date, she leaves. Michael follows. On the way home, they decide to take a shortcut through the local graveyard. There, it begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual thriller dance is amazing. It&#39;s full of those trademark Jackson moves, as well as some memorable zombie moves, too. It doesn&#39;t appear rushed at all, nor too long. The whole thing seems movie-like and it really is actually rather scary. Of course, it&#39;s one of the most famous music videos of all time, and is probably the greatest music video ever made as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Watch it, seriously. Those 13 minutes will be some of the best ever spent staring at a screen. (5/5)&#34;
b&#39;&#34;Nazarin&#34; directed by Luis Bunuel presents an extraordinary view of religion in Mexico. As written by the director and Julio Alejandro, his notable collaborator, this was a film that put Mexican cinema in the international map after receiving the Grand Prix in Cannes that year. It\&#39;s a disturbing film because Mr. Bunuel delves deep into what\&#39;s wrong with the church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nazarin, by all reckoning, is a saint. This young priest is seen living a life of poverty in a seedy pension of a city. He doesn\&#39;t have enough for himself, but he doesn\&#39;t mind parting with a coin when a beggar appears by his window asking for help. At the same time, he takes into his small room a prostitute that has been hurt in a fight with another woman. Andara, the woman repays his kindness by burning the room and the whole building! Nazarin is seen taking to the countryside begging for food. Andara and Beatriz, two prostitutes from his old town follow him. Nazarin\&#39;s life parallels that of Jesus. In fact, this saintly figure makes a case for humility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course,Mr. Bunuel had no religion in mind when he and Mr. Alejandro took it upon themselves to create this film. It\&#39;s ironic how Spain welcomed him after this film was released because they saw it as showing Christian qualities, when in reality, this is an acerbic satire on the catholic church and its ministers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Francisco Rabal, the Spanish actor, makes a wonderful Nazarin. This was one of his best roles. Mr. Rabal worked extensively in his native country, but also in Mexico and Argentina. Rita Macedo, as Andara, is also excellent. Marga Lopez also makes a valuable contribution with her portrayal of Beatriz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great film by one of the cinema\&#39;s master film makers: Luis Bunuel.&#39;
b&#34;The net is an excellent movie! It&#39;s about Angela Bennett(in a great performance of Sandra Bullock) who is a computer expert who works for the Cathedral Company, cleaning virus and testing games for the clients. Angela is a typical nerd who doesn&#39;t have friends outside of the cyberspace,almost doesn&#39;t take vacations and go out, and stays almost all the time connected. One day her friend Dale Hessman(Ray McKinnon) asks her to help him,sending Angela a disk with a strange program that has many confidential informations. At the same night, when Dale was going to meet her, he is suddenly killed in a plane crash.Going to Mexico in her vacation,Angela meets a beautiful guy called Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam)who shows to be a cold blood killer bastard and one of the guys behind all the secret of the Diskette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her life then turns into a nightmare: All her records are erased and she is given the new identity of Ruth Marx, a woman with serious problems with the police.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is great because it shows how we, humans,depend a lot of the computers and machines(sometimes more that we should) and how vulnerable we are if someday ,someone decides to control and change our personal records,without letting us the chance to prove the error.&#34;
b&#34;Crossfire is one of those films from the Forties that is crying for a remake, if for no other reason than maybe it&#39;s time it should be done as originally written. The story on which the film is based is about the killing of a gay man. But anti-Semitism was certainly a hot topic in the days of post World War II with the holocaust fresh in everyone&#39;s mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Lee Server biography of Robert Mitchum, Edward Dmytryk the director was interviewed and and bluntly said that the film could never have been made about a hate crime against gays at the time with The Code firmly in place. It could have been though because the character of Robert Ryan is such an equal opportunity hater of everything that deviates from his societal norms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mitchum was told in no uncertain terms that he was in the film strictly for the ride. Robert Young was cast as the Washington, DC Police homicide captain who catches the case and while Mitchum was second billed, he knew from the beginning the film would belong to Ryan. But he was RKO&#39;s new star by dint of his performances in The Story Of GI Joe and Till The End Of Time so he was there for box office insurance. Mitchum&#39;s part was as a sergeant and friend of the original suspect in the case, George Cooper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crossfire is not a whodunit, even though we don&#39;t see the crime it becomes clear that Montgomery is the one who kills Sam Levene, the quintessential Jewish salesperson. And it becomes clear to Young and Mitchum that Ryan is the guilty party almost as fast as it does to the audience. It becomes just a question of getting the evidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryan earned one of several Academy Award nominations the film garnered, his Best Supporting Actor category. Though he lost to Edmund Gwenn, the film was Ryan&#39;s breakthrough role. Similarly Gloria Grahame was nominated for a brief part as a party girl for Best Supporting Actress, but she lost to Celeste Holm for Gentleman&#39;s Agreement. In fact Crossfire ran up against Gentleman&#39;s Agreement and lost for Best Picture and Best director for Dmytryk to Elia Kazan. It&#39;s fifth nomination for Best Screenplay and Crossfire came up short again with the winner being Miracle on 34th Street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gloria Grahame also had her own problems on the set which spilled over from her personal life. She was having big trouble with her then husband Stanley Clements who was an abusive husband. He was hanging around the set causing Ed Dmytryk a lot of problems. Fortunately Grahame&#39;s part was a small one. In fact the whole film was shot in typical RKO economy style in 20 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Young has a particularly fine scene with William Phipps a young kid from Tennessee in Mitchum and Ryan&#39;s outfit who Ryan constantly belittles. Young is most eloquent in speaking about the corrosive nature of hate and how it affected his family as Irish Catholics who came over in the potato famine years. It was one of Robert Young&#39;s best moments on screen in his long career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As fine a film as Crossfire is, it&#39;s time to be remade as a story about an anti-gay hate crime. Especially with the real killing of Barry Winchell from the last decade and the debate about gays in the military.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s a film who&#39;s time has come and almost gone.&#34;
b&#39;This film stars Peter Lorre as an exceptionally nice guy who immigrates to America. Unfortunately, shortly after his arrival, he\&#39;s in a horrible fire and his face is horribly burned. Because he looks so awful, no one wants to hire him and out of sheer desperation, he resorts to a life of crime in order to earn the money needed to buy a mask to hide his ugliness. Where exactly the film goes from there, you\&#39;ll just need to see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I scored this movie an 8 because, for the money spent to make it, it\&#39;s a heck of a good film with a lot of good twists in the plot to keep it interesting. The film could have degenerated into a simple horror or crime film, but it goes far beyond this an offers some genuine surprises. In addition, the excellent acting by Lorre shows that he was capable of more than just supporting roles. This is an excellent film and delivers more than most &#34;A-pictures&#34; of the day.&#39;
b&#34;Coming from Oz I probably shouldn&#39;t say it but I find a lot of the local movies lacking that cohesive flow with a weak storyline. This comedy lacks in nothing. Great story, no overacting, no melodrama, just brilliant comedy as we know Oz can do it. Do yourself a favour and laugh till you drop.&#34;
b&#39;This film launched my theory about films based on books: Instead of following the cliche &#34;You\&#39;ve read the book; now see the film,&#34; if you are looking for a good book to read, try one upon which a movie you like was based, because it\&#39;ll be 10 times better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this film on its initial release at the National Theater in downtown Eugene and liked it so much that I stayed to see it again. It\&#39;s a perfect merger of the inspiring talents of one of my favorite actors, Jon Voight, with what became my favorite book, &#34;The Water Is Wide,&#34; by Pat Conroy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can think of no better movie about the nobility of teaching and the ironic challenges of life. Two tiny caveats:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) The video suffers severely from pan-and-scan and deserves a letterbox version. (2) The title should be restored to the name of the book, a reference to one of the most touching, enigmatic songs ever written&#39;
b&#34;No. I&#39;m not kidding with this one. He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave this movie positive marks. And who can blame him? This is a charming, upbeat, and rather funny Disney movie. Who doesn&#39;t love kittens? The music in Ev&#39;rybody Wants To Be A Cat is jamming. It makes me want to snap my fingers or something. Only years later when Cats Don&#39;t Dance came out have I seen a movie that was that musically fun. What Aristocats lacks in animation and story, it makes up for in charm. Plus, everything moves at a relaxed pace, and even the villain isn&#39;t all that scary. It&#39;s perfect for the younger set while not being so sappy that adults can&#39;t like it. If Snoop was here, I&#39;m sure he would say the same thing. Yeah. Dig those CRAZY cats, man.&#34;
b&#34;This film is utterly amazing. From the performances of Huppert, Girardot, and Magimel, to Haneke&#39;s screenplay and direction there is not a single misstep. The film may put some people off with it&#39;s hard sexual subject matter and with it&#39;s slower pace, but it really is a masterful piece of cinema... so do not let it&#39;s challenging ways keep you away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powerful, and deserving every award it won in Cannes!&#34;
b&#39;This is the episode that probably most closely relates to it\&#39;s partner law, &#34;Thou Shalt Not Kill,&#34; in that it directly brings up the ever controversial issue, &#34;Why do we kill people who kill people to show that killing is wrong?&#34; This issue is presented in two parts within the episode: before the killing, when the film shows the dichotomy between the idealistic up-and-coming lawyer and the street thug so caught up in his ways that his life is merely a representation of what he\&#39;s supposed to do, followed by the period after the trial and before the execution, when both are made to suffer for the deaths they feel responsible for and thus share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the great things about the way these episodes work are in the both small and big ways the story is fully developed, so that we understand both the motivations and histories of characters we\&#39;re only able to spend slightly less than an hour with. For all his criminal intentions and mockery, the killer is still very sympathetic, revolving the most important part of his actions around a history of accidental death. His way of killing is more a desire to control death than it is any desire to actually destroy. Similarly, the lawyer\&#39;s idealistic naivety shows one unwilling to allow death to happen in a world where he can\&#39;t control it. Their meeting is, indeed, important; they both have to give in to it while not propagating it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, it\&#39;s interesting how much this episode affects viewing of Rouge, Kieslowski\&#39;s later completion of the Trois Colours trilogy. One of Kieslowski\&#39;s biggest influences seems to be the idea of justice, and considering that the Decalogue is a meditation on something that represents Divine Justice, this one seems almost the most self-conscious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--PolarisDiB&#39;
b&#34;Where to Begin, I like the scary snow-monster named Jack Frost. The whole concept works well for me, we thought he&#39;d be back and he was. Changing the local to a tropical resort works. Seeing old friends and meeting new characters. Scott MacDonald does a great job as Jack Frost, you can tell when an actor has fun playing a villain, you can see it or in this case hear it in the performance. Yup, Jack Frost 2 is a welcomed sequel that is better then the first. I do have one complaint, the little Jacks or the Jacklings as I call them. They looked like hand puppets. I think they could have done a better job with the Jacklings, the mouth could have opened wider, but the CGI was good and as a whole the whole movie is worth watching over and over again. If you liked JACK FROST, then you will like this sequel. No questions or debate, 9 BIG STARS.&#34;
b&#39;I found this one to be more chaotic than the average Stooges short (as strange as that may sound). There were several funny bits, especially the running gags (&#34;Calling Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard!&#34;, the glass door breaking, the Stooges running into the supply room and coming back out with... well, you know), but also quite of bit of it was taken up with things that just didn\&#39;t make any sense to me. I have to assume that these were generally take-offs of scenes from the film &#34;Men In White&#34;, but since I don\&#39;t know much about that movie I can\&#39;t say for sure. Maybe if someone could explain these I\&#39;d appreciate this short more.&#39;
b&#34;All in all, Big Bad John was a hilarious, and touching movie. If you want romance, tragedy, and humor, this movie&#39;s got it. If you&#39;re a fan of the song (like I am) you pretty much know how it ends. But if you don&#39;t, or do and want to watch it anyway, I strongly recommend this movie. Jack Elam and Jimmy Dean are a hilarious pair with great chemistry. However, I wouldn&#39;t recommend this movie to strict urban folk. You have to understand where these people are supposed to be coming from, and only a handful of us are left. But even a few urban folk might understand it, and appreciate it for what it is: a good, down home movie that&#39;ll make you laugh, cry, and be inspired.&#34;
b&#39;Like one of the other reviewers (might have been @ Amazon), I was first introduced to Tourist Trap by the beloved, decrepit old WOR-9 in NY, around January 1983. Devil Dog: The Hound of Hell, which I\&#39;d been waiting to see since it debuted on Halloween 1978, had just ended, and I thought I\&#39;d had my horror fill for the day (quit laughing - that three eyed &#34;Borgost&#34; (sp?) monster Ike Eisenmann draws up in his room is scary).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For as much as I still enjoy Richard Crenna wearing his made-for-TV horror hat, it was the first 10 minutes of Tourist Trap, following Devil Dog that day, that really left a mark - and months later, it ended up being the first movie I ever taped off TV. WOR used to play this fairly frequently, often as the Saturday afternoon Million Dollar Movie, as others have observed. It\&#39;s one of those offerings that delivers a powerful horror punch up front, a veritable left hook - and then practically starts over with the rest of the cast, dances and jabs, putting the opening scene a larger context along the way, then moves on to the real climax (see Night of the Living Dead, Re Animator).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two paragraphs and I haven\&#39;t mentioned a single mannequin. Face it - the damn things are scary enough, without the music and the script. I, too, can remember some scary dress dummies and the like in various relatives\&#39; attics and basements, and say what you like about how relatively straightforward Schmoeller and Carroll\&#39;s approach is - no one, before or since, has played it this well. In real life, a good mannequin will make you do a double take - and here, that\&#39;s about the last thing you\&#39;re likely to see, if you happen to be stuck at Slausen\&#39;s defunct wax museum and roadside stand. Yes, there is a point (&#34;I loved her very much&#34;), where Chuck &#34;Slausen&#34; Connors is trying to pass for Vincent Price. Yes, the plot might have taken up all of a paragraph in the early stages; I can\&#39;t see the script being all that thick. It doesn\&#39;t matter. From direction to competent acting (Meryl Streep\&#39;s emphatically not in attendance, and here, that helps instead of hinders), to another useful and effective Pino Dinaggio score (see Carrie and various other de Palma movies), to various lighting, film stock, use of varying sound levels ... I could go on - every element of this low budget production comes together and you get a work very much greater than the sum of its parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention it\&#39;s scary as Hell? Stephen King talked this movie up in Danse Macabre a year or so after its release, and with good reason. Like much of his work, it may not be great art, but it sure does tell a scary story, and does it well. The rest of the cast may be relatively unknown (wasn\&#39;t Jocelyn Jones in that Texas car chase movie as well?), but Chuck Connors and Tanya Roberts were and are, just familiar enough to audiences, to make you think - Stephen King style - that this could happen to you, or people you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparisons to Psycho (plot) and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (overall look and feel), even if they aren\&#39;t the first associations in my mind, are valid. I only wish I could comment on the DVD, which I look forward to buying, as Tourist Trap has become notoriously hard to find on video since the near-complete extinction of independent video rental outlets, where it had a home aside from WOR and cable in the 1980s (though TMC/Showtime appear to have picked it up and play it regularly now). No, no spoilers here, I\&#39;m afraid, no plot breakdown - go see it yourself (all right, there may be a tiny little one below, so scroll away if you like - better safe than sorry). The mannequins are damn scary and I\&#39;d rather show than tell ... :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, Tourist Trap is also chock full of great lines, from &#34;we are going to have a party! How do I look, huh, how do I look?!&#34;, to &#34;you\&#39;re so pretty&#34;, &#34;you can\&#39;t hurt me&#34;, &#34;I shouldn\&#39;t have to hide it - it feels good!&#34; (listen for that Vincent Price inflection again there), the inevitable &#34;you\&#39;re crazy!&#34; (delivered at the right moment, and in the right tone) ... and try - just try - to keep the hair on your arms down when you hear the mannequin\&#39;s head screaming &#34;Molly!&#34; - especially once you realize whose head it used to be ... :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P S ... Charles Band was the producer on this, I believe, and likely owned the rights to Dinaggio\&#39;s music. Band, from what I understand, was the brains behind Full Moon Entertainment, which might explain both the music\&#39;s subsequent use in Puppet Master, and, well, the 40 commercial approach has characterized Full Moon throughout, from the enjoyable Puppet Master and Subspecies franchises, to, uhhh ... Trancers and Bad Channels (sorry, BOC).&#39;
b&#34;I&#39;ve felt that Rupert Grint has a lot of promise from that role by which everyone knows him. So even though I had never heard of this film before, when it appeared in my cable TV listings, I immediately switched to that channel. I am so happy that I did! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve read from other reviewers that they don&#39;t generally like coming of age stories; I on the other hand quite do. I am one of those who is always coming of age; I have been since I was 12, I&#39;m 52 now, and I will probably continue until I&#39;m 92. Coming of age is nothing more than suddenly realizing the possibilities that another day brings. The suddenness of the realization, the magnitude of it, sometimes throws us into disarray. If we try to shelter our delicate selves from that, then yes, I can see how the coming of age can end. But if we simply dust ourselves off, and settle into the new direction we&#39;ve discovered, then we&#39;re all of a sudden on a new path, and we&#39;re just as alive as we were yesterday, only stronger, brighter, and I daresay, more interesting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#39;s what this movie was about. This was a coming of age story all the way round; young Ben, his father, Father Robert, and certainly Dame Evie... all went through a marvelous transformation. In fact, so too did Mr. Fincham, didn&#39;t he?! All did, I suspect, except in fact the mother, in spite of her enormous opportunity so to do, provided by the events of the end of the film. One is left with the feeling that she will continue on exactly the same path she&#39;s been on, only with perhaps a different supporting cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So an excellent film, that could not possibly have been made in America, which is utterly depressing to think about, but thank God we have a steady supply of films made elsewhere that we occasionally get to see. I really heartily recommend this film, so long as you don&#39;t mind cringing through those parts of it that are all too familiar to us all, and grinning through all the rest of it.&#34;
b&#34;I finally got hold of the excellent Sazuma DVD of this film which is loaded with interesting extras. I have read quite a lot about it, and I unfortunately missed it at the Stockholm Film Festival. It doesn&#39;t quite deliver as I thought it would but it is still worth watching if you like strange and unique movies. I much rather watch this again than any of the recent so-called horror films vomited out of Hollywood these days. What detracts from the experience for me, is certain music cues which sound dated and rely too much on cheap synth sounds. For me, all these tonal/harmonic elements of the score could have been lifted out, and replaced by David Kristians excellent sound design. But that is just my opinion. Otherwise this is a daring, angry picture with welcome meditative and poetic parts, like the fading of the photograph sequence which is beautiful. I look forward to seeing Ascension, and I applaud Mitch and Karim for their efforts in producing non-mainstream cinema. They are a great inspiration as I soon embark on my own short film production.&#34;
b&#39;Cooley High was actually a drama with moments of comedy. It was a reflection of high school life back in the day. I attended Coolidge High in Washington, D.C. from 1976 to 1979 and much of what was in Cooley High was an every day thing at Coolidge. As a matter of fact after the movie came out everybody started calling Coolidge &#34;Cooley High.&#34; Getting high, shooting dice, chasing girls, basement parties, and fights, that sums up high school life for many in D.C. back in the day. I can\&#39;t forget Motown because Motown music began and ended many a day back in the 70s. The hits just kept coming. However, Cooley High adds a layer of humanity over the craziness because when all was said and done just like in Cooley High my classmates and I had a lot of love for each other. And like the characters in Cooley High there was life after high school, but there was nothing like waking up every morning and experiencing each day to the fullest from homeroom to seventh period. Thirty years later we are getting ready to celebrate those good times. Cooley High is definitely a period piece that just gets better with time because like it or not the only thing left from those days are memories, some good, and some bad.&#39;
b&#39;As many of today\&#39;s movies are guilty of, the plot isn\&#39;t exactly stellar, the movie doesn\&#39;t move anyone, and certainly this won\&#39;t warrant any award (outside of Blockbusters\&#39; perhaps)...but then again, who really cares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro team up to produce a very funny, at times hilarious, movie that I really enjoyed. Russo and Shatner played their small parts well as well. Man, I hope in the future my wife ages as well as Miss Renee has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving along, this &#34;buddy&#34; cop-flick produces high laughs in a reasonable amount of time. The movie is enjoyable enough to avoid the wait for video/dvd release and instead to go ahead and check it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eddie Murphy is at his usual top-form and is downright enjoyable to watch. De Niro has molded into this type of role perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed this movie and think that any true movie fan in need for a good movie or just a good laugh will really enjoy Showtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top Performance: Murphy. Hilarious. Enough said. Directing Job: Nice. Nice action scenes, used Murphy and De Niro together like a charm, Russo fed off in a nice supporting job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Rating: 7 out 10. It\&#39;s not going to move you or anything...but it\&#39;s an extremely enjoyable movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s Showtime...was a great success.&#39;
b&#39;Checking Out will be released Friday September 15th, 2006. through the AMC theater chain starting in New York City. Times Square, 66th and 3rd Ave, West 84th Street. This film has been one from the heart, for the heart. Mark Lane, Jon Karas,Richard Marcus, Jeff Hare, Dana Harrloe,Matt Jensen Ed Abrams, Nick Pike, Peter Falk, Laura San Giacomo, David Paymer, Judge Reinhold, all the cast and crew knew from day one that this film was something special. The need to comfort the elderly is intended, the closeness of family is more apparent now then ever. I would recommend this film to all ages and races. This story rings the truth to anyone with or without family.&#39;
b&#39;This is a cult film for many reasons. First because of the phenomenal success as a musical both in Broadway and London, then as a musical film. The film is close to the play and some of the provocation of the play is no longer provocative twelve years later. The discourse against the Vietnam war is no longer a protest song against the war itself, but a strong song demonstrating how the young people of these late 60s managed to bring the political establishment down. Milos Forman play with some situations at the end of the 70s like the narrow minded justice, the self-centered umbilical righteousness of the rich or of the little ones who have just one rank of power more than the powerless. He also heavily plays with the racial element and the sexual ambiguity he builds all the time. The film remains pleasant and thoughtful. And of course it is a tremendous thrill to remember these years when we have had the privilege, and that was not a chance, to live them. November 11, 1969, Nixon ordering mass celebration for the 1918 armistice, which became the order for teachers at all levels to take their students to the celebration and the march, supporting thus the invasion of Cambodia that was in full swing. And some dare give lessons in democracy to foreign countries. I also remember the long campaign for the impeachment of Nixon in 1973-1974 that will eventually lead to his resignation and the swearing in of Gerald Ford, the first Vice President, and eventually President, of the US who had not been elected, since he was appointed Vice President by the Senate after Spiro Agnew had to resign to face trial, conviction and sentence for embezzlement. Of course that makes us think of today when in 2000 a president of the US was not elected by the people but by the Supreme Court, or of a war that was rejected by millions world wide from the very start, and even before the start, and was started against the better judgment of the United Nations and of three permanent members of the Security Council. And some speak of a new world order based on the respect of others. Modern Western man seems to have some problems understanding that the world is changing and has already widely and wisely changed. Modern Western man seems to be kind of out of sync and to need special evening classes to learn that democracy wants the majority in the world to be the majority, and the West is far from that majority, and that if the Soviet block had been able to understand that market economy is not capitalism but that market economy can be either socialist or capitalist the Berlin Wall would have fallen, but the other way round, and that China has learned that lesson marvelously well and is at the foot of the wall they have to climb over to learn that their socialist market economy has to lead to political democracy, but they will, just like Vietnam was able to reconstruct itself after thirty years of vicious war aggression and damage. In other words, Hair is a perfect food for thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines&#39;
b&#39;This film says everything there is to say about religion - I wish it were required viewing for all bigots and would-be clericals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story, set in a turn-of-the-century Danish villages is about two very religious sisters whose late father was a rigid priest who discouraged all their dreams of love and exploring the world and its many beauty. They are now old and their life and beauty spent. Their quiet new help - whom they &#34;teach&#34; to cook - is Babette (played by the lovely Stephane Audran who graced so many of her husband Claude Chabrol\&#39;s films). The life in the village is simple and the stark direction reflects that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Babette wins the lottery, she requests a chance to prepare a feast - a true labour of love. The course of the feast and its Chief Guest reveal messages of love and spirituality and how there are many ways to love God and life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must-see for the devotion with which Babette prepares the feast and for the speech the General gives at the end. Possibly the best international film of the 1980\&#39;s.&#39;
b&#39;Bud Abbott and Lou Costello always had a good following among children, but in their careers I think you could say that they only made one film that could be designated for kids. Jack and the Beanstalk was that one film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was part of a two picture independent deal from Warner Brothers, the second film being Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd. These were the only two films the boys made in color. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two of them, out of work as usual, take a job for a very precocious and obnoxious young David Stollery as a babysitter. Although it starts out with Costello wanting to read the kid, Jack and the Beanstalk as a bedtime story, the young lad winds up reading it to Costello. Lou falls asleep and in his dreams he fantasizes he\&#39;s indeed Jack the Giant Killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buddy Baer who menaced the boys in Africa Screams plays the giant and he\&#39;s got a giant size Dorothy Ford as his housekeeper. Dorothy was a big girl, 6\&#39;2&#34;, and you can imagine she had some difficulty being cast except when her height was used as a joke. One of the only players who ever looked down at her was John Wayne in Three Godfathers at 6\&#39;4&#34;. Henry Fonda and James Stewart in On Our Merry Way also stood barely above her, but again her height was part of a gag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaye Cogan and James Alexander were the princess and prince of the fantasy and they sang beautifully, but couldn\&#39;t act worth anything. This was the last film of William Farnum who\&#39;s career dated from the early silent screen days and even to the turn of the last century on stage. He played princess Shaye\&#39;s father the king.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some not terribly memorable musical numbers came from Jack and the Beanstalk, save the title song. I well remember as a kid having the 78 record of Bud and Lou singing the song and reciting the story. I was in my early single digit years, but became a lifelong fan of their\&#39;s through that and their television series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jack and the Beanstalk is still a good children\&#39;s picture for the very young, though I would warn parents to warn their little urchins not to imitate young master Stollery.&#39;
b&#39;I just recently bought &#34;The Big Trail&#34; {1930}. It\&#39;s an awesome, amazing film. I knew it by reputation but never expected it to be so magnificent. My version is the one shot in 35mm and I\&#39;ll speak of that again later. When one thinks of the Western Myth in film the names that come to mind are John Ford and John Wayne. Well, you have only half the team here, but the entire Myth is present. Raoul Walsh has given us a remarkable epic in which the true plot is the struggle of the westward expansion of the nation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a plot centering on a romance between Breck Coleman {Wayne} and Ruth Cameron {Margaret Churchill} with the main villain, Red Flack being memorably played by Tyrone Power, Sr. But this has an almost incidental quality as the wagon train struggles forward against incredible obstacles\xc2\x97both natural and human. Examples are the crossing of the river, the Indian battle, and traversing the burning Desert. The aftermath of the battle is given a sombre touch when a doll is placed on the grave of a child killed while a faithful dog lies down on its master\&#39;s grave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magnificent panoramas are filled with energy and activity. The opening scene as the wagon train prepares to leave, the Square Dance interlude and the great Buffalo herds are some that spring to mind. Marvellous use is made of location shooting throughout. Another feature of this splendid film is the fact that men and women are given equal credit for their parts in the great struggle Westward. Women work, fight, and confront the terrible hardships with the same fortitude and strength as their male counterparts. The finale has a powerfully uplifting experience as Coleman and Cameron meet in the gigantic towering Sequoia forest to start their new life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is quite acceptable throughout. I\&#39;ve already mentioned Tyrone Power\&#39;s scene-stealing performance. Tully Marshall is excellent as Coleman\&#39;s sidekick, and Marguerite Churchill convincingly portrays a woman who develops an inner strength as she encounters her own problems as well as those external to herself. The comic-relief is the weakest aspect of this film, but these scenes are not common and are swallowed up in the tremendous sweep of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;ve read much criticism of Wayne\&#39;s performance\xc2\x97some even going so far as to blame his &#34;wooden acting&#34; for the failure of the film at the box-office. I think this is unfair. Wayne was in his first major role and certainly had not developed the charisma of his performance in &#34;Stagecoach&#34;. But he still does a serviceable job in a role which is certainly going to play second fiddle to the great over-arching theme. After &#34;The Big Trail&#34;, Wayne played in a large number of low-budget B Westerns. I have a number of these and one can see the developing actor in them. When &#34;Stagecoach&#34; came he was ready for it and &#34;The Big Trail&#34; was a significant part of that apprenticeship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned earlier that my version is the one shot in 35mm. It\&#39;s still impressive, but to get some idea of the effect of the 70mm version I set the TV screen to 16:9 which doesn\&#39;t cause any distortion. While not having the complete effect of the Grandeur version, it was good enough to make me want to get the latter. {in addition, the film shot in 70mm has a few extra scenes not in the form made for ordinary theatrical showing}.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, this film deserves to be in any list of the greatest Westerns ever made.&#39;
b&#39;My take on the ending. Bobby died at the hands of his step father. Mike had tried as he may to get Bobby out. Only a child could think that it would be possible to build a machine that could fly. Bobby died.... Mike as a child survived by creating an alternative ending in his mind...on how Bobby left....Mike made a plane that flew Bobby out. Children who are sexually and violent abused often create whole other worlds in their minds to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was also great seeing my old housing area. We called it San Jose Boulevard and I lived right around where these house were filmed. It was so strange to see that they filmed inside the houses...not studios... It was my kitchen, bedroom and living room. And those hills...we use to hike them as kids....looking down on our little valley....seeing glimpses of the bay. Was a real nostalgia trip for me.&#39;
b&#39;I love the Thackeray novel on which this film is based. And while this modern version of Becky Sharp\&#39;s story is a B film, the casting of Loy, in her first top-billed role, is rather fascinating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Loy became MGM\&#39;s reigning good girl in scores of genteel and comic roles, she was an actress. VANITY FAIR was Loy\&#39;s follow-up film to EMMA, in which she played a snotty and greedy daughter who almost destroys the loyal housekeeper (Marie Dressler).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loy\&#39;s Becky is much nastier than Miriam Hopkins\&#39; version 3 years later in BECKY SHARP. Loy\&#39;s Becky is very much a pre-Code film character with her plunging necklines and amoral ways. It\&#39;s the type of character that Jean Harlow or Clara Bow could easily have played, but Becky here is still supposed to be of the genteel set. That\&#39;s what makes her fallen character so tragic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In counterpoint to Loy\&#39;s grasping Becky is the goody goody Amelia (Barbara Kent) who is just not an interesting character. Mary Forbes is icily good as Mrs. Sedley. Most of the other actors in this version are pretty blah: Conway Tearle as Rawdon; Walter Byron as Osborne; Anthony Bushell as Dobbin. Others are nearly Dickensian is their quirkiness: Billy Bevan as Joseph; Lionel Belmore as Crawley; Montagu Love as the Marquis; Lilyan Irene as Polly the maid; Elspeth Dudgeon as the housekeeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loy is front and center throughout. While the ending is rather shocking, she has several excellent scenes, such as the gambling scene in the casino where she tries to steal another woman\&#39;s winning roulette bet. The more Loy\&#39;s Becky descends morally, the more beautiful she gets until she is finally &#34;caught.&#34; Bottom line here is that this is a very solid performance by Loy in a film that should be seen.&#39;
b&#34;Seeing Les Amants Reguliers calls immediately for comparison with Bertolucci&#39;s movie &#39;The Dreamers&#39;, in my opinion the best film made about the 1968 revolt of students in Paris. Actually director Philippe Garrel does not seem to avoid comparing with his much more famous colleague, sharing the principal actor and even including a direct replica eye-in-viewer-eye about an older film of Bertolucci. And yet, LAR is a different film, and an interesting one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story line seems also familiar. The movie starts with long scenes of the 1968 &#39;emeutes&#39;, maybe among the best done until now. The film is made in black-and-white, and the perspective of the static camera on one side or the other of the barricade reminds Eisenstein. Then, as in The Dreamers, the action moves in the Parisian flat where the heroes of the defeated revolt make art, smoke drugs, dream, and fall for one other. There is no direct social comment, no real explanation of the background of the revolt. The movie focuses on the psychology of the characters and on the love story between the main characters. It&#39;s like a premonition of the process of transition to the establishment that the generation of the 1968 went through, it&#39;s just that not all the participants may adapt or survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is more about the characters than about the events. And it is merely for the style it will be remembered about. The black-and-white cinema is memorable not only in the revolution scenes, but also when looking at the characters evolution. Many sequences are enhanced by a technique that is derived from the silent films movies, with long takes accompanied by a off piano tune. The effect is exquisite. Yet the length of the film is hardly justified, it lasts more than three hours and I doubt that cutting it to only two hours would have been a miss - actually I am convinced it&#39;s quite a contrary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without raising at the depth and subtlety of Bertolucci&#39;s movie LAR is another perspective to remember about one of the more important years in the history of France and of the world in the 20th century.&#34;
b&#39;One of Starevich\&#39;s earliest films made in France is possibly his only political satire. The story of The Frogs Who Wanted A King mirrors its title as a group of high &#34;croakers&#34; feel that democracy has gone flat so they demand a king from Jupiter to rule their land. When he sends down a stump, the frogs ask for another king, saying the stump is but &#34;political timber.&#34; Jupiter sends down a hungry stork this time whose frog lusty eyes devour the town\&#39;s residents. As the original &#34;croaker&#34; is about to slide down the stork\&#39;s beak, he speaks his moral: &#34;let well enough alone.&#34; This film features a few beautiful crowd scenes of dozens of puppet frogs. Starewicz tricks the audience into believing they are all moving at once by keeping the background in constant motion and animating only about six frogs or so at one time. The slightly corny dialogue and problems with lighting in a few places diminish the quality of repeat viewings, however its historical significance in Starewicz\&#39;s life make it of importance to watch. His feelings towards government immediately following his flee from Russia are likely expressed in this film. In addition, the technical accomplishments of animating so many characters at once in a stop-motion film is astounding.&#39;
b&#34;i expected it to be good, after i&#39;d seen some other ozon&#39;s superb moments, and read much about it... but this movie is brilliant - clever, very bright (emotionally and visionally), perfect in all moments. every movement is there for a reason, everything fits so closely and primordially true and honest. this is the movie about the beauty and innocence; about it&#39;s simplicity.&#34;
b&#34;Don&#39;t let the rating of 5.9 (as of this writing on 12-8-02) fool you, this is one excellent film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot fathom how this got such a rating considering being so solid at all levels. The direction, acting, cinematography--all good. The story is interesting and original and my only inkling as far as understanding why the rating is such, sits in the fact that it is probably the type of movie that people rating might not normally see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I equate it to playing modern rock for an 80 year old. You might be young, brought up on it and love it, but he or she has not been and as a product of a different time and taste--doesn&#39;t care for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like films and can handle movies based more on real people versus those comprised of mindless action, enormous flashy budgets and mediocre talent, give this one a try next time you see it on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;
b&#34;I first saw this movie as a younger child. My sister had told me about it and I thought it would be more of a kid&#39;s movie. However it remains to also be an incredible movie. True that the subject behind the movie is ruff but also true this movie will never stop touching your heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was only 6 when I first saw it and just yesterday, 7 years later, I saw it again. For the first time in a long time. Even after I knew how it ended, I knew that I had seen it a billion, bizillion times I wept like a teeny weeny little baby. When I saw it a few years back I finally got the idea and the seriousness of the film. So I stoped watching it for a while. But yesterday I didn&#39;t change the channel, I watched it. By the end I was astonished at how much it still made me laugh, cry, think, and above all, believe in mericals again. I haven&#39;t belived in a long time and this movie got me out of my shell and opened up my heart. This movie wasn&#39;t just impacting. I was also so impressed with the actors. Especially Bobby. So if you are wanting to see this movie for the first time I suggest seeing it alone. With tissues. And being ready to discover your young, sweet, innocent side and the side that still has hope. This movie touched my soul when I was only 6, and even in this time of trying to figure out who I am this movie helped me realize both what I don&#39;t and still do want to be in life.&#34;
b&#39;I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan, where it drew a huge crowd and some pretty intense discussion. I really admired the story and visual approach. The action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is amazing. There is much beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes. Not just in the desert but in the city too. My best scene was after the boy discovers his friends in the apartment and then rides his skateboard through all the remarkable lights of the city. You really feel for this guy. I never heard of the actors before but I liked all three very much. I think they did a terrific job on their journey to self-discovery. All in all, this is an amazingly cool and suspenseful suspenseful film. I still carry many of the images in my mind.&#39;
b&#34;I usually give horror films around 6/10, but this one caught my eye. House of Wax was by far the best horror film I have seen... Even better than the Amityville Horror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paris Hilton was quite good in this and I must say, has a good future ahead. Her death scene was probably the coolest. I&#39;ll just say how she dies...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She gets a giant pole right between her eyes and they close-ups on and everything. Gory, eh? Brian Van Holt was very good as both the killers, Bo and Vincent (Vincent had the long hair). Usually he plays a mean cop or soldier, but he did very well in this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eliza Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray also acted very well as Carly and Nick Jones. Nick took the spotlight in the first half of the movie, then Eliza stole it back by enduring a lot of pain in the second half like getting the finger clipped off, ripping her lips apart after they got glued together, and getting a straight forward punch in the face by Bo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give this movie an 8/10. Fans of horror films MUST see this.&#34;
b&#34;My wife wanted to see this movie and I grudgingly went along. I have never been a big fan of the biopic - believing that cinema is more exciting when it isn&#39;t structured in non-fiction. Beyond that, although I like Ray Charles&#39; music just fine, I don&#39;t consider myself a fan of him or his music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected to either suffer or coast through this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an engaging story told in a classic cinematic style. The realism is in the nuances - the tilt of a character&#39;s head after a dramatic moment or the look in their eyes while they sing. I literally discovered myself involved in this movie during the course of viewing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jaime Foxx, of which much has been said, heads a cast of immaculate re-creators of not just a time, but an ERA, a LIFE that never really existed to those of us under forty. This movie sinks the audience into time without the gimmicks and grand sweeping panoramas of Titanic or other period pieces of that ilk. This movie doesn&#39;t present you with the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s music scene, it takes you there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a movie about Ray Charles, but your appreciate of it should not be limited to the story of his life. This is the kind of movie, like Saving Private Ryan or Schindler&#39;s List, that does what a movie should do - bring you to another place, another time.&#34;
b&#34;This is a 1972 Disney movie. For the time, I was eleven years old and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Feeling nostalgic, I purchased the three series DVD&#39;s of the Dexter Riley movies and even now, at age 46, I still enjoyed them. It was all about fantasy, magic, and clean fun. And it still is! I wasn&#39;t sure which of the three movies came first then second and last. So now I have the official dates. On December 31, 1969 The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes--On July 12, 1972 Now You See Him Now You Don&#39;t--On February 6, 1975 The Strongest Man In The World. I still think the middle movie was the best. The special effects were amazing back in 1972 to us kids. I definitely recommend it to all ages.&#34;
b&#34;This film, won&#39;t win any awards for greatness. But if you have an hour and a half free and fancy a bit of light hearted entertainment then you could do much worse than watch this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cast are mostly young and pretty, the script has some genuinely funny moments and the soundtrack is pretty cool too. Rupert Penry-Jones as Jake seems to have the most fun, while Laura Fraser as Justine is sweet, likable and funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rented it because I like the series &#39;Spooks&#39; that RPJ is currently starring in. And here he&#39;s young and buff and the perfect eye candy for a girls night in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get some wine and some ice cream and have a chuckle.&#34;
b&#39;I was five when the show made its debut in 1958 and at a later point, was a regular viewer. I remember that I really enjoyed the show, along with &#34;Leave It To Beaver&#34;, &#34;My Three Sons&#34;, &#34;Ozzie and Harriet&#34;, &#34;Dick Van Dyke&#34;, reruns of &#34;I Love Lucy&#34;, &#34;The Real McCoys&#34;, etc. I am now enjoying the first season of &#34;Donna Reed&#34; on DVD and have watched the first two episodes. Donna Stone is shown to be an intelligent, well-mannered, problem-solving, serene, stay-at-home mom, similar to June Cleaver and in contrast to Lucy Ricardo. In episode 2, I especially like how Ms. Reed becomes a surrogate dad, trading in her dress for sweats and boxing gloves, while teaching her son how to defend himself physically against a much larger bully. While none of the mothers in the neighborhood I grew up in, including my own, exactly met the idealistic standards portrayed by Ms. Reed, it is refreshing to see good manners and intelligent decision-making prevail at the end of the day, in contrast to today\&#39;s accepted standards of vulgarity, selfishness and indifference among one\&#39;s neighbors. I cannot imagine Jeff and Mary Stone being told by their parents that trespassing in their neighbors\&#39; yards is okay, leaving a dog outside to bark all day is acceptable, or telling their mother to &#34;shut up&#34; in a supermarket in front of everyone.&#39;
b&#34;I agree with the guy above, It is so funny I understand it all, but my friends just don&#39;t get it. Go to Japan and you will see a different movie after being there. When I met my girlfriends dad, at his home in Kanagawa. I swear I felt the same as Jack,. scared, but by the end of the day it was all good, so I give this movie a 10 out 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have watched it at least 30 times, taking it with me to watch on the plane flying to Japan next month. One thing that is real good is the ball game scenes. Makes me feel like I am there again. This is a must see if you have any interest in Japan and Baseball. Too bad they don&#39;t make a sequel. Does anyone know where the temple scenes were filmed and the argument with hirko in the walkway with a roof on it???? need to know so I can win an argumrnt with me Japanese ex-wife. thanks&#34;
b&#39;On June 22nd, 1941, the city of Przemysl, Poland is divided between German and Russian. When the German invades the city, the Nazis send the Jews to a ghetto. The young Catholic Fusia Podgorska (Kellie Martin), alone with her young sister, lodges and hides many Jews in the attic of her house along two and half years until the end of the war. &#34;Hidden in Silence&#34; is another good story of human sympathy in World War II. This film looks like &#34;Rescuers: Stories of Courage&#34;, and is also based on a true story. Unfortunately, the actress Kellie Martin performs a strong and powerful lead character, but she is very weak for such a role. In many dramatic situations, the expression of her face is not convincing. I have noted that many IMDb Users liked her performance, but I am not sure whether they like her wonderful character or her performance indeed. My vote is seven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title (Brazil): &#34;Ocultos no Medo&#34; (&#34;Hidden in Fear&#34;)&#39;
b&#34;I have seen most of the Tarzan episodes. Certainly the rated X with O&#39;Keeffe &amp; Bo Derek, which is totally deplorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen this version several times since it was originally shown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the cast had memorable parts, great acting the Ape sequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night I viewed same on Spanish station and other than some French dialog all in Spanish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as Hudson not wanting Andie&#39;s voice he did nothing until the very end. He viewed the dailies and could have hired a dialog coach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems silly that a story about apes and a man raised by them all speaking gibberish that Hudson attacked Andie.The story line in the movie was that she was an American cousin. The last time I checked Carolina was in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was beautiful in movie and her eyes, and gorgeous hair, alabaster skin mystified all us males. She did not have to resort to Bo&#39;s level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has remained a LADY throughout the rest of her career and should look at this movie (half her life ago),as a starting point. Her performance, sincerity, made this movie enjoyable, believable that a half wild man could ascertain her inner beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great sending point for Sir Richardson, he did steal the movie.&#34;
b&#39;Even an old cynical DOCTOR WHO fan like myself can be left breathless by watching an episode of my favourite show . It happened previously during Eccleston\&#39;s finale and it happened watching this episode . It doesn\&#39;t happen often though but The Impossible Planet is an example of both the show and of television at its very , very best . This is stunning television &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Doctor and his companion land in a mysterious place where they see strange writing on the wall and the audience ( Many of who will be moving behind the sofa ) are instantly transfixed . A door opens and horrible monsters start stalking the time travellers . This might have taken up an entire 25 minute episode in the original show but all this takes place in he pre title sequence . You may miss the longer drawn out format of the original show but at least this new series is tightly plotted and if we\&#39;re treated to a disappointing story then at least it\&#39;s usually only for one week &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing to disappointment a viewer here . It is DOCTOR WHO at its most traditional best . Writer Matt Jones and director James Strong have gone out of their way to make a story that will be regarded for years to come . They do this by constructing a doom laden narrative . The Doctor and Rose lose the Tardis and they\&#39;re stuck with the protagonists in the far flung future . It\&#39;s interesting how many stories never feature this type of plot point where the Doctor and his companions no longer have access to the Tardis which makes for a more intriguing type of story . Without doubt the highlight is the scene where Scooti goes to look for Toby only to find him standing on the surface of the planet where he turns and beckons her outside . Everything from acting , make up and Murray Gold\&#39;s music makes this a scene that genuinely shocks its audience &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can imagine immediately after this episode the BBC switchboards received a tsunami of complaints for distressed parents saying how traumatised their children were . That it took them several hours to get them from behind the family sofa and that they\&#39;re now refusing to sleep with the lights out . To do this complaining would be to deny the magic of DOCTOR WHO . Yes it can terrify and yes such images will burn themselves in to the mind of a child , something they will never forget even if hey live to be a hundred . But I will bet my life that these same &#34; traumatised &#34; children would have spent the week begging that no matter what they\&#39;ll be allowed to watch the next episode&#39;
b&#39;If you like Cagney you\&#39;ll like this film. It has the pretense of American integrity at any cost, personal or social. Cagney plays the head of weights and measures in NYC. Cagney goes up against crooked politicians, the criminal underground, a prominent philanthropist and simple grocers who add a few ounces to the price of a chicken. The chicken scene is hilarious where Cagney finds a weight placed in the bird cavity by an unsuspecting butcher. The chicken gets tossed around the shop in a hilarious scene about who controls the &#34;evidence&#34;. If you like old telephones there are interesting scenes of dials, phones and even bizarre phone cords. Compared to a lot of film made today this is pure entertainment and includes mystery with comedy and a message that honesty above all should be the guiding principle of humanity. Made in simpler times it reflects a world we can\&#39;t find today. The fashion (especially hats) outwear and automobiles all play a prominent visual role in defining this little film.&#39;
b&#39;Mikio Naruse\&#39;s examination of the lives of three idling, constantly complaining, single ex-geishas in post-war Japan is a wonderful character piece. They used to be friends in the old days but now their relationship is strained because one of the women has become a successful moneylender and the other two owe her. Although the moneylender is the only one who has become successful in this rebuilding economy, she is the only one of the three that has no children. The other two each have a child whom they depend upon for income, because neither of them work. Complications ensue when the kids decide to get married (though not to each other) and leave home. This leads to the bitter, grumbling old women to become even more bitter and grumbling, getting drunk and bemoaning their rotten children and inconsiderate friend the moneylender. Meanwhile the moneylender is herself unhappy, despite her fortunes. She has no one besides her young deaf maid to keep her company and chance encounters with two former lovers from her geisha days lead nowhere - all they really want is to borrow money from her. The three characters are all neck-deep in the quicksand of their own bored lives and are too weary to struggle much, usually opting instead to resign themselves to the futility of it all or, at the very most, toss complaints back and forth to each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Late Chrysanthemums&#34; is very slow-moving and not much actually happens but Naruse, like all great directors, has the ability to do much with very little. I haven\&#39;t seen much of his work but I suspect that this isn\&#39;t his best, even though it is very good. The problem, I think, is that it all doesn\&#39;t seem to amount to much. But the film is full of good points. Although it is cynical, it isn\&#39;t overly so. Naruse seems to sympathize with his desperate characters, and he paints vivid portraits that make the characters seem even somewhat noble in the squalor of their self-made misery. While the film isn\&#39;t a must-see, it is important as a fragment of the work of a great little-known (outside of his own country) director, precious little of which is available on video here in the U. S.&#39;
b&#39;I find it remarkable that so little was actually done with the story of the a-bomb and it\&#39;s development for decades after the Manhattan Project was completed. My suspicion is that this was due to serious fears in the movie and entertainment industries (in the 1950s through the 1970s) with &#34;McCarthyism&#34; and related national security phobias (including the Hollywood blacklist). There was one film in the 1950s (with Robert Taylor) about Col. Paul Tibbits who flew the Enola Gay in the Hiroshima bombing, but otherwise nothing else. One could glance at a side issue tragedy (the sinking of the U.S.S. Indianapolis soon after the delivery of the bombs to Tinian) in Robert Shaw\&#39;s description of the shark attacks on the survivors in JAWS. But the actual trials and tribulations of Groves, Oppenheimer, and their team was not considered film-able.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then in 1989 two films appeared. I have reviewed one already (DAY ONE) which I feel is the better of the two in discussing the lengthy technical and emotional and political problems in the Manhattan Project. The acting of Brian Dennehy as General Groves and David Strahairn as Oppenheimer was first rate and neatly balanced. Small side vignettes concerning the anti-bomb crusade of Szilard (Michael Tucker) help fill out the story well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That\&#39;s the problem here. Paul Newman is a great actor (as is Mr. Dennehy) but Newman approached Groves in a different way that while not dreadful is lesser than Dennehy\&#39;s intelligent but soft spoken military brass. Newman seems too popped eyed about the possibility of the weapon as the biggest stick to confront the other boys in the after-school yard with. Yes it certainly was, but the real Groves would have been more like Dennehy keeping his mind not on that great toy of the future but on the business of creating that great toy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dwight Schultz\&#39;s performance as Oppeheimer helps maintain the film\&#39;s basically interesting and good production, aided by Bonnie Bedelia as his wife. But the most interesting aspect of this film is in the upgrading of the two tragedies of Daghlian and Slotin, in particular the latter, in the character of John Cusack\&#39;s Merriman. Inevitably in all technological advances people are killed. It\&#39;s just that these two tragedies (on top of the tens of thousands that were lost in Hiroshima and Nagasaki) brought home the dangers of the new unleashed power even in a so-called peaceful, controlled experiment. The two tragedies (particularly Louis Slotin\&#39;s slow, agonizing death by radiation poisoning) showed how much care was needed in using atomic power - and how the barest of chances could still cause disaster. The only really different thing I saw in Cusack\&#39;s performance (and the script) and the actual incident with Slotin was that Slotin actually took some time after the accident to figure out where all his fellow research scientists were when they were hit by the radiation from the accident (he was able to show that only he got the full effect of the accidental blast, so that only relatively minor treatment would be needed by the others). Perhaps the full story of Slotin\&#39;s actions was too technical for the screen, but given the humongous pain he suffered in the end that he took time off to think of the others shows what a first rate person he really was.&#39;
b&#34;looks like the bet movie I&#39;ve ever seen. not too much for intelligent perception but so rich for perception sensitive. Antonioni is comparably wise to his movie. Malkovich&#39;s so organic, roles are so true, situations are so real. I&#39;ve change my world outlook after this cinema. I&#39;m a beginner literati in Russia -- country of Tolstoy and Dostoevskiy -- and I&#39;m quite sure watching Antonioni is good and fun for russkies, because I and we do understand his point of view. so I don&#39;t understand his lesser raiting on IMDb. I&#39;m sure, speaking from Russia and our people, we like Antonioni because of his romantic soul and positive sensation of surrounding reality&#34;
b&#34;Having reviewed 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I would get them all done now. Dads Army, is my all time favourite sitcom, It ain&#39;t half hot Mum is also a classic as is You Rang M&#39;Lord. I don&#39;t regard Hi De Hi as a classic, but it is still funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s about a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, it&#39;s yellow coats. It is ran by Jeffery Fairbrother, a well meaning man, but has the personality of a sock. The staff include fun entertainment manager Ted, his sidekick Spike (he ended up being thrown in the swimming pool nearly every episode), yellow coat Gladys, careless maid Peggy who longed to be a yellow coat and the Punch and Judy man Mr Partridge who hates kids. Situations occurred mostly round the swimming pool, where someone would be thrown in every episode (with there clothes on of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a classic, but still funny. Jeffery Fairbrother left half way through, so this, a bit like Only Fools and Horses, outstayed its welcome. Jimmy Perry was actually a red coat at Butlins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Episode: Peggy&#39;s Big Chance, series 2, episode 2.&#34;
b&#39;*SPOILERS*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t care what anyone says, this movie is friggin\&#39; hilarious. This is the sequel to Jack Frost, a movie about a killer snowman. The snowman is created when a convicted serial killer about to be executed is taken to the execution chamber, but the truck crashes with a truck carrying DNA manipulation chemicals that make human DNA bond with dirt, or in this case, snow. The first movie was just boring, and eventually the snowman is destroyed by pouring antifreeze on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or so they thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie takes place about a year after the second. Some scientists resurrect Jack Frost by mixing the antifreeze with chemicals. No explanation is ever given for why they do this, they just do. Meanwhile, the sherrif who arrested Frost in the first is going to the Bahamas. Unfortunately, the snowman comes with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie has it all. It has talking carrots that can stand up, ice cubes that explode when you stick them in your mouth, and killer snowballs. Yes, killer snowballs. They even say &#34;Dada!&#34; like babies. I\&#39;ll have to give the makers of this credit. The snowballs are some of the cutest little things ever dreamed up. I wish that I could get one as a pet. Frost finally freezes the island, as if a killer snowman has the ability to influence major weather patterns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there\&#39;s the actors. There\&#39;s Manners, the FBI agent from the first movie, except here he\&#39;s wearing an eyepatch. YARR MATEYS, SHIVER ME TIMBERS, I BE AN FBI AGENT! YARRR! And then there\&#39;s the stereotypical British adventurer and the stereotypical black Jamaican with dreadlocks. And finally, Captain Fun. The fruitiest man on the face of the planet, bar none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie isn\&#39;t scary, but is is hilarious. I laughed my butt off the whole way through, and I recommend this for anyone who likes a good &#34;bad&#34; movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** out ****&#39;
b&#39;I have some great memories watching &#34;Robin of Sherwood&#34; on TV as a kid (but I think I only saw Michael Praed\xc2\xb4s episodes, by some reason). And recently my brother bought the new released DVD-boxes of the complete series. It was great to see it again, and it is the best of all the Robin Hood movies and TV-series. The cast is great, and the locations mixed with Clannad\xc2\xb4s music adds this very special feeling. I personally think that Praed is the best of the two Robins, but Jason Connery was a great choice to continue the series with. Ray Winstone, Nicolas Grace and Robert Addie is terrific in their roles as Will Scarlet, The Sheriff of Nottingham and Guy of Gisburne. It\xc2\xb4s a pity that a fourth season never got made, and I\xc2\xb4ve also heard that the writer Richard Carpenter actually had plans to make a feature film following the events of the series. Robert of Huntingdon (Connery) could finally have married Marion (Judi Trott), or maybe Herne the Hunter could resurrect Robin of Loxley (Praed), and he could take his revenge against the sheriff. As have been mentioned before; if the producers of &#34;Robin Hood: The Prince of Thieves&#34; would have been smart, they would have got the cast from &#34;Robin of Sherwood&#34;, and made the movie to a sort of sequel to the series. As Ray Winstone puts it in the DVD bonusmaterial, it would have been great to see them as old men, just like in Sean Connery\xc2\xb4s &#34;Robin and Marian&#34;. Who knows, maybe we will se more of this perfect interpretation of the legend in the future. In any case, we can now watch our favorite series over and over again!&#39;
b&#39;Anyone looking to learn more about the development of skateboarding should find Dogtown and Z-Boys adequate research material. This is not to be confused with Lords of Dogtown, that sorry Hollywood attempt to cash in on the success of the original Dogtown revival. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directed by Stacey Peralta, a former Z-Boys himself as well as pro skater and mastermind behind the 80s Bones Brigade, and co-written with skateboarding photojournalist Craig Stecyk, this documentary traces how a group of surfing kids from Southern California\&#39;s mean streets (known as Dogtown) who formed the Z-Boys skateboard team (actually there was one girl--Peggy Oki) revolutionized skateboarding. The film contains interviews from nearly all of the Z-Boys (Chris Cahill\&#39;s whereabouts are unknown) with the most noteable being bad ass Tony Alva and the youngest, Jay Adams, who\&#39;s talents (along with Perlata) seemed to transcend the rest of the teams. There are interviews of the team\&#39;s (and the Dogtown shop) founders, surfboard designer Jeff Ho, Skip Engbloom, and Craig Stecyk. There are also interviews of folks like Tony Hawk (obviously), Ian McKaye (Fugazi), and Henry Rollins, who were young kids in the 70s when Dogtown was making it\&#39;s influence on skateboarding (skateboarding was a whole other context in previous years as the documentary explains). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really shows you not only who the Dogtown team was and how they formed, but why their style changed not only skateboarding tricks (pool skating became immensley popular, and thus gave way to vert skating), but also facilitated the sport (though not into the extreme commercialism it is today) as more than just the fleeting fad it had been earlier as these surfing kids who\&#39;s waves ran out in the early morning needed ways to spend their time and eventually got into skateboarding. The days of Russ Howell and Alan Gelfand were long over as the Dogtown, at least through the publicity of their skate team, paved the way for the new generation of skaters. Because Dogtown got all the attention, they were able to push skating to the next step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a great documentary in the way that it is put together, though Stacey Peralta always knew how to do this even when producing the Bones Brigade mini movies/skate demos like &#34;Ban This&#34; and &#34;Search for Animal Chin.&#34; Narrated by Sean Penn, the film is accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack, contains lots of terrific archive footage, and lots of interview to give you a genuine feel of who the Z-Boys were and how they made their mark on skateboarding.&#39;
b&#34;Yes, maybe there are parts of this film which require suspending belief a little but that doesn&#39;t take anything away from the film&#39;s charm and wonder. It was shown as part of our town&#39;s youth film festival and was the organising committee&#39;s favourite. Which is not surprising. The subject matter - coming together in a race-torn, though post-apartheid South Africa is highly topical and the treatment of the theme is inspirational. Of course, as the previous comment mentions the film does have its shortcomings, but the realism of the setting and the way the director treats his subject matter belies these shortcomings. I saw this with my wife and we returned the same evening with the children. A film to watch, meditate, discuss and act upon.&#34;
b&#34;NORTHFORK is above all a masterpiece of widescreen cinematography. For this alone the film is well worth one&#39;s time. The stark, wide open plains and badlands of eastern Montana are captured in the spare, muted earth tones of autumn or early spring. The gigantic grey cement Fort Peck Dam is the film&#39;s protagonist. The film comments both subtly and not so subtly on about a dozen issues of Western Landscape. The dialogue can be trying at times, yet the images and concepts are powerful enough to lift the film. The 1950&#39;s period works so well here and is executed so well. I think that the passing years will be kind to this film.&#34;
b&#34;I know this film has had a fairly rough ride from the critics, but I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. The real star here is the fantastic Dylan Moran. He never fails to be both hilarious and convincing in all of his varied disguises. He also manages to radiate a sweet charm that belies his outrageous pratfalls. Special mention must also go to Michael Gambon who plays for laughs with a brilliantly accurate and yet comedic inner city Dublin accent. The only weak link is Caine who, while obviously having a great laugh hamming it up, plays the least interesting and most unsympathetic character. It probably won&#39;t play that well overseas but it&#39;s well worth a watch all the same.&#34;
b&#39;I liked the movie but it should have been longer. The actors did a great job. Portia De Rossi is a fabulous actress and Kristoffer Polaha is a hottie. He didn\&#39;t look like John at 100% but he did favor him from a distance. I look forward to seeing more of him on the big screen. He didn\&#39;t have john\&#39;s charisma, but he definitely has a charm about himself. He has beautiful eyes and a great smile. He reminds me of my boyfriend alot. Ms. Bissett was just too breathy for me. She should have that asthma checked out. Im not going to comment on the Darryl Hannah character. My mom always said, &#34;If ya can\&#39;t say anything nice, then shut the hell up!&#34; so that\&#39;s what Im gonna do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molly&#39;
b&#39;I can\&#39;t believe this movie only scores 7.4! This surely ranks up with the best of Hitchcock\&#39;s movies such as VERTIGO or MARNIE. The only reason I can think of why the score is so low, is that for the most part, THE MAN... renounces violence and certainly won\&#39;t get a diploma in &#34;sex and crime&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it derives its tension from is not violence, it\&#39;s the reckless energy of these criminals that take a child from his parents and are ready to kill the kid if the operation fails. Today, having seen a lot of hardboiled kidnapping movies as Mel Gibson\&#39;s RANSOM, this seems normal, but in the 1950s, where family was all in contemporary America, the thought of such a crime surely has stirred up emotions a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this tension still works for me, today. Yeah, these guys are selfish, ignorant bastards, disturbing in how they act: It\&#39;s a deal for them, and they want to be &#34;good businessmen&#34;, disregarding the fact that business here is kidnapping kids and assassinating politicians in the opera!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes the movie great, however, are the creative aspects, the kinky ideas of Hitchcock, the outrageously disturbing scene in the church (which brings it to the viewer\&#39;s attention how alone, how abandoned the protagonists are, nobody caring, nobody helping, the people in the church just going home...), the meeting with the owner of that shop stuffing and preparing dead animals (which stresses the somewhat &#34;oriental&#34; flair the movie has from the opening scenes abroad), last not least the role of MUSIC in this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Music is the key principle here, as ***SPOILER*** the assassination of the targeted politician is to be done exactly in the moment of a loud orchastra tutti/gong; so Hitchcock lets the camera follow the orchestra score and you now it will happen in a second ***BANG*** And then, of course, DORIS DAY singing Que sera, which became more famous than the movie itself; she sings it to notify the kid of his parents being in the embassy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all: A classic!!&#39;
b&#34;A fantastic movie, and very overlooked. Gary has never been more handsome, and Ingrid is more beautiful than in ANY other film. If you don&#39;t believe, just watch the movie. Every cast member is wonderful; the love scenes between Gary and Ingrid will make your pulse race! The story is great, the script is Oscar caliber. Don&#39;t miss this film!!&#34;
b&#34;I&#39;ve seen a few of Mr. Boorman&#39;s movies and didn&#39;t like much of them. Not that they are bad movies, quite the contrary are good movies, but not content I personally found entertaining. However I think Where the Heart Is, although made to cater to the less than art savvy American audience, is masterful as satire, and as social commentary of the times it was made in. I&#39;ve had to replace this movie in my collection at least a half a dozen times, since every time I loan it out to someone I know could appreciate it&#39;s artistry on all its levels, my copy fails to come back home to me, lol. The last time took 7 years to replace it since it was out of print for VHS sales, has never been made as a DVD that I know of, and had to wait till one of the premium cable channels ran it before I could tape it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite aspect after the nail-on-the-head social commentary is the paintings by Timna Woollard. I&#39;ve searched for 15 years to find anyone or anywhere that could lead me to where her work is available for sale. Or better yet a copy of the paintings in the movie without the ending credits rolling over them. I have a room in my house that I dedicated to putting copies of her paintings in, and no one seems to know if it ever was released as a coffee table book, or video aquarium, or as a documentary of her work. If anyone does know of where I can acquire any sort of copy of Timna&#39;s work or where her studio is in England, please do not hesitate to contact me via email.&#34;
b&#39;David Cronenberg movies are easily identifiable, or at least elements within the movie stand out as his trademarks. Fetishism, the blurring between the organic and inorganic, squishy throbbing things that shouldn\&#39;t be squishy and throbbing. &#34;eXistenZ&#34; is classic Cronenberg. Briefly, it\&#39;s about a future generation of computer games, but instead of a video monitor, visuals are supplied by your mind. The game plugs directly into a \&#39;bio port\&#39; in the base of your spine and while the game is running, the player can\&#39;t tell reality from game. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays the game\&#39;s developer, guiding a novitiate marketeer, Jude Law, through the game\&#39;s paces. While in the game they uncover strange goings-on and possible crimes. But are they real, or is it the game? Not even the game\&#39;s author knows. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is quite a treat, keeping the viewer engaged, but in the dark until the final minutes. Another thing I like about &#34;eXistenZ&#34; is that it doesn\&#39;t use a heavy reliance on special effects, it\&#39;s the story itself that propels the movie. Recommended for the Saturday night when science fiction is called for.&#39;
b&#34;Hadnt heard a lot about this movie, except it being National award and Oscar entry. Its a Marathi movie, n I cant make out apple from orange in marathi. But when I saw the movie playing on DD1 late Sunday night, I just got glued. Now I am no judge of cinematic techniques and acting skills. But I have watched a good number of movies, of various genres, and for an average viewer, I will highly recommend this movie. The feel is very earthy and realistic, though there are some melodramatic moments. Watch it to feel human. Lately haven&#39;t seen any movie, which touches heart, especially in Hindi cinema. the crowning achievement of the movie is when the young kid returns home. The camera moves around to reveal the kid, wearing black glasses, having lost his eyes, the kid hears the other kids splashing in the water and starts clapping. I was awestruck. And the two hours I spent watching the movie - very much worth it :-)&#34;

b&#39;A pig-tailed Linnea Quigley drinks milk, strips and kills her sister and her sister\&#39;s boyfriend after they have sex. She goes to an asylum, makes a best friend out of Amy (Karen Russell) and the two blackmail their way out of a mental institution by sleeping with their psychologists (one is played by &#34;Carol Burnett Show&#34; regular Lyle Waggoner). On the outside, these two man-hating mafia princesses (!) stop taking their medication and invite six slimeball ex-boyfriends over to their large country home for a party where they\&#39;re systematically slaughtered in very gory ways by a gloved, leather-clad mystery killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hideous David Barton FX are so bloody, but so unrealistic that they take on a sort-of surrealistic quality. Same goes for the movie. The dialogue is so strange and stilted, the film so ineptly paced and edited and the acting so other-worldly, you\&#39;ll start to doubt your own sanity. This film actually attempts to have a plot and three-dimensional characters, but it\&#39;s all so poorly handled it\&#39;s almost like what would happen if Ed Wood did a rewrite of an Ingmar Bergman script! And like any good Bergman film, this has a mature moral to abide by--Any good party needs a proper guy/girl &#34;ratio,&#34; so there will be enough chicks to &#34;tickle your lizard.&#34; See it for yourself... or don\&#39;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linnea (the only reason I was even interested in watching this to begin with) is very amusing in this one, has a lot more dialogue than usual and has several eye-popping nude scenes. Unfortunately, she also completely disappears from the final third of this film and the movie suffers because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Score: 3 out of 10&#39;
b&#39;I\&#39;m a huge fan of both Emily Watson (Breaking The Waves) and Tom Wilkinson (Normal) and was amused to see them upstaged by Rupert Everett (Dellamorte Dellamore) in this shockingly rather minor movie that had all the ingredients to be so much more. The too brief scenes in which he portrays a languid, infinitely entitled, worthless son of a rich Lord are spot-on and entertaining. But for a love triangle there was remarkably little chemistry to speak of between anyone. The music was annoyingly movie-of-the-week quality, and the voice-over jarring and totally unnecessary. Clearly the work of a first-time director with a small budget who either lacked or didn\&#39;t sufficiently heed good advice. Too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can appreciate how the people you kind of hate at the beginning are the ones you kind of like at the end, and vice-versa, so there is some sort of character arc, at least in terms of perception. For example, Watson\&#39;s character, while refreshingly honest to her husband about her feelings for another man, began to grate on me near the end, particularly when she announced to her husband that she simply had absolutely no control over her actions, and later when she simply declared that she would be moving back into their marital flat, with no asking of permission, no apologies offered. And I went from disliking Wilkinson\&#39;s control freak / moral relativist character to sort of understanding him and not really wanting him to change (unlike his wife).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie awkwardly morphed from a whodunit to a &#34;Love Story&#34; or &#34;Steel Magnolias&#34; illness drama without sufficiently informing me of the fact, so I was left distractedly guessing what the next plot twist might be long after they had all been revealed (Was it the Lord driving the car? The Lord\&#39;s dog?). The scene where the Lord visits Wilkinson and relates how brave Watson is, the bestest nurse any dying boyfriend could ever ask for, Florence Nightingale incarnate, etc. was OK until he started over-the-top sobbing like a baby. Good God! If you ask me she\&#39;s just another flitty rich person with way too much time on her hands, and so she drives her hard working, well providing spouse crazy with unnecessary drama. Her screwing around was just another way to occupy her empty life; the dying guy thing was an added bonus for her as it somehow made her previous actions completely above reproach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, everyone would have been better off if Wilkinson had just left her for his secretary, who seemed to appreciate him for who he was. Instead he acted like an abused dog, his open craving for his wife\&#39;s affection increasing with every kick she gives him. I\&#39;m not anti PC or anything, it just didn\&#39;t ring true, even after taking into account all of the harsh realities of middle age we all tend to face. The ending for me was (and not the director\&#39;s intention I am certain) depressing. The movie spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people just don\&#39;t belong together, so I found no joy in the promise of their relationship continuing. I\&#39;m not above wanting my emotions manipulated by a story, it just has to be somewhat plausible and not hackneyed. Is that asking too much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My score: 4/10&#39;
b&#39;GEORGE AND MILDRED was a spin off from the mid 1970s sit-com MAN ABOUT THE HOUSE . Though I haven\&#39;t seen the series since it was last broadcast I do remember it being fairly amusing with most of the comedy arising from the eponymous couple going to live beside the snobbish Fourmile family , a sort of LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR without the cynical racist gags .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having seen this &#34; big screen version of the show &#34; I find myself asking what it\&#39;s a big screen version of ? Certainly not of a popular mid 70s sit com of the same name . For some reason the movie jettisons all character interaction from the television by having George and Mildred leaving the street where they live behind and getting caught up in a plot involving some serious gangsters who want something George has inadvertently picked up and which leads to some cringe making situations and lines like: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34; Did he give it to you &#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34; No that\&#39;s the first time a man has resisted my charms &#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34; I meant the envelope &#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do get the impression that screenwriter Dick Sharples ( Who never wrote an episode for the original sit-com ) has never seen an episode of the source material and has got the show confused with the CARRY ON series of films . In many ways it resembles the same mistakes of the latter LOST IN SPACE movie in that it has absolutely nothing in common with the series that spawned it&#39;
b&#39;The world now seems to be in an odd stage of downsizing, in which objects such as DVD and CD players are steadily decreasing in size. It is obviously much cooler to have a smaller iPod than a larger one. This is not so with theater screens, as is the case with the IMAX, the enormous, widely-known theater system that has stunned audiences upon its release, and to this day. As long as the material\&#39;s right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main problem with \&#39;Magnificent Desolation: Walking on the Moon 3D&#34; is that it uses the huge screen as its main advantage. It is dull, uninformative, and relentlessly eager to please and amaze us with its corny special effects and inspiring quotes from famous names such as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Another problem with the film is that it doesn\&#39;t even take the time to sit down and interview those lucky few who have had such an extraordinary experience as to have been to the moon. Instead, the writers have simply pressed COPY and PASTE and hired famous voices such as Morgan Freeman, Bill Paxton, and Matt Damon to imitate their famous quotes. This tactic is unrelentingly repetitive and tedious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;d say without one moment\&#39;s hesitation that I didn\&#39;t learn one piece of information from the film that I didn\&#39;t already know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it repeatedly insisted on irritating the crap out of me with its insistent sentimentality. Every three minutes there seems to be a cue for Tom Hanks\&#39; voice to say something like &#34;Without the contributions of these brave men and women...&#34; Watching the film is like watching a bad commercial. For forty agonizing minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/4&#39;
b&#34;Like the previous two &#39;Mad Max&#39; films, &#39;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&#39; is not exception to the violence and strange plot. Mad Max is in a post-war society where he must destroy master blaster and get the children to &#39;tomorrow morrow land&#39;. This is generally a warped film with Peter Pan references and Tina Turner, methane-pigs, and odd characters. I got very bored by watching it all, and it offered nothing to me. I did not feel inspired after watching this film; the only decent thing about this film were the extremely-odd characters that got picked off in various ways throughout the film. It&#39;s too weird for me, and it was much too dull.&#34;
b&#39;An Asian blowgun assassin takes out victims in Niagara Falls and New York City before getting run over by a car. Sheila Morris (former Miss Sweden Janet Agren, given a hilarious &#34;Southern belle&#34; dub to show she\&#39;s from Alabama) finds a connection between these killings and the disappearance of her sister Diana (Paola Senatore) and sets out to investigate. This brings her to New Guinea where she promises a sleazy guide (Robert Kerman i.e. American porn star R. Bolla) 80,000 dollars to help locate her sister. After barely making it through a jungle full of bloodthirsty cannibals, they finally locate Diana, who\&#39;s under the control of Jim Jones-type cult leader Jonas Melvyn (Ivan Rassimov). Jonas does the typical mad guru-style things, like passing out LSD, initiating group suicide, threatening to kill anyone who disobeys him and raping Agren with a giant dong dipped in cobra blood. Every once in awhile a character will look to the right or left and see a gory scene lifted directly from JUNGLE HOLOCAUST or MAN FROM DEEP RIVER (both of which were also directed by Lenzi). I\&#39;m pretty sure they also use at least two scenes from CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST as well. Here we get the expected animal slaughter scenes (gutting a gator; natives eating live snakes), plus some additional nudity and a castration. Me Me Lai shows up to give her breast implants another workout playing a widow who is gang banged by three of her brother in laws on top of the ashes of her freshly cremated husband. Mel Ferrer briefly appears as a professor and isn\&#39;t given much to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, with MANGIATI VIVI! you pretty much get a promise fulfilled with all the nudity, gore, dead animals and bad taste you expect with one of these titles, so if you\&#39;re a sleaze hound, by all means watch it. Personally, I got bored with it about midway through and just wanted it to end. The original (heavily cut) U.S. release in 1985 was titled THE EMERALD JUNGLE in order to trick people into thinking they were actually renting John Boorman\&#39;s EMERALD FOREST. It was also called DOOMED TO DIE and EATEN ALIVE BY CANNIBALS!&#39;
b&#39;i though this film was okay.i din\&#39;t think it was great.it was a bit too slow for my taste.lots of drama,but not very much action until close to the end of the film.this movie was basically a dramatic film,with the payoff,if you can call it that,not until near the end.to me,the scenes of the dam bursting and the water flooding the town,were okay,but much too brief.the film itself is done okay,the acting is decent,but it just didn\&#39;t do it for me,in the long run.think it had something to do with the fact that there was very little suspense or tension built through the whole movie.at least that\&#39;s what i think.the other factor is that i had just recently watched \&#39;10.5\&#39; and its sequel \&#39;10.5:Apocalypse\&#39;.these are 2 big budget &#34;event movies,which,in my opinion, are a very hard act to follow,in terms of special effects and scenes of destruction.as a result,i have to rate Killer Flood:the Day the Damn Broke at 4/10&#39;
b&#34;I rented this TV movie version of &#39;Troilus and Cressida&#39; out of my library last thursday, and simply could not believe my eyes. Where should I begin? no effort was made to make the play look remotely like it was about the Trojan war, all the actors were wearing Elizabethan dress. Moreover, most of the actors were too old and horribly miscast - Aeneas (with his white beard) looked older than Nestor, Troilus was at least 30, Hector looked like a Spanish pirate, Ajax was badly played anyway and Thersites was a transvestite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likewise the action is poor, the duel between Ajax and Hector is short and amateurish, the camera angle focuses more on Nestor&#39;s face, so we can only see what is going on in the background which is frustrating in itself. Nor is the &#39;battle&#39; at the end given it&#39;s due respect. We do not see Troilus and Diomedes fight, nor anyone else for that matter, Paris and Menelaus just seem to mud wrestle in front of Thersites. Even Patroclus death was omitted. All this was a major disappointment considering I waded through a very dull 2 and a half hours of BBC costume drama to get to that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, it wasn&#39;t all bad. I thought the Incredible Orlando as Thersites and John Shrapnel as Hector were well played, even if they didn&#39;t look quite right. I&#39;d say the same about Kenneth Haigh as Achilles, since he didn&#39;t have the striking countenance and was a bit dry at times. SPOILER: The climax at the end - the death of Hector - was perhaps the best part of the film, Achilles&#39; dialogue here is excellent and sums up the attitude of a cold, seasoned murderer. However, the gruesomeness of the scene (when Achilles stamps on what was Hector&#39;s head)sets it apart anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles Gray as Pandarus was delightful as a sleazy old pervert and I thought the actress playing Cressida did an OK job. The war-mongering Troilus, however, was annoying and I think that the play would have been better perhaps if he had been murdered by Achilles instead of a peacenik like Hector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion? OK, but could have been better if it had had a younger cast and costumes that at least attempted to look Ancient Grecian, not to mention the lack of action. 5/10&#34;
b&#39;I really like Kinski he is a great actor. I\&#39;ve seen this movie because I\&#39;ve heard that there are autobiographic aspects in this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is full of symbols like a piano sinking in a river or strange shadow-pictures at the walls. Then the narrator always says abstract sentences like: &#34;A kid sells fortune, but her box is empty now.&#34; This is really disturbing and wasn\&#39;t really necessary, because everyone understands what this movie is all about. The movie shows how Kinski\&#39;s character treated woman, and how he kept them under control. If there are really some aspects of Kinski\&#39;s life in this story - then he really was an swine. So there is no need to watch this movie, unless if you want to see Kinski naked or if you like sick trash movies to laugh about.&#39;
b&#34;A new wrestling show paves way for the most feared wrestler ever imaginable, the giant Zeus. Network President Brell does everything in his power to draw WWF champion Rip into the squared circle to face off against Zeus for the championship of the &#39;Battle of the Tough Guys&#39;. But Zeus is unlike any competitor Rip has ever faced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I would give Hogan some leeway as a wrestler crossing over into a movie role, however this film didn&#39;t ask the Hulkster to make very much of a stretch, it simply asked Hogan to play himself, which he failed at miserably. &#39;Tiny&#39; Lister made a good effort as the mighty Zeus, but even his work left the film lacking something, namely acting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch this movie, if you so desire, with a grain of salt and a sense of humor, otherwise you will probably have to turn it off a little over ten minutes in.&#34;
b&#39;The storyline of this movie is clich\xc3\xa9 and obviously has been ripped off from Jurassic Park. The filmmakers didn\&#39;t even try to hide that. It seems as though there was not enough budget to make decent dinosaur-dolls, so instead the viewer sees some robot-like toy-dinos (from a cheap toystore) which move in a very unnatural way. It\&#39;s funny though, because it\&#39;s so bad. The acting is almost as unnatural as the dinos are. No one seems really excited to be in this movie (which I totally understand). Especially the last half hour is extremely boring and it\&#39;s almost impossible to watch it without falling asleep. The one positive comment note I\&#39;d like to make about &#34;Raptor&#34; is that it doesn\&#39;t take a full 90 minutes.&#39;
b&#34;It&#39;s hard to comment on this movie. It&#39;s one of the few movies Dimension actually has not shelved (it&#39;s hard to come up with a reason why) and it was rushed into a an unimpressive 500 theaters it&#39;s opening day. Maybe Dimension was afraid of how people would respond to a swamp creature using his tow truck to pull a house apart piece by piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ray Sawyer is just a tow truck driver, until he rescues a Voodoo priestess from a bad car accident, and in return, he gets attacked by a bag full of snakes and drowns. At the morgue, Ray comes back to life, and stalks a group of teenagers who witnessed the awful crash occur. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What brings this movie down is it&#39;s paper thin characters. I didn&#39;t care for one moment about any of them. Also, the dialog was less than ho-hum. Also, it was very predictable. Characters did the typical stupid horror movie character things, like check creaky noises, call out people&#39;s names, and trip on a rock while being chased. I also could immediately pick out who the final girl would be. And why did the camera have those quick white flashes whenever somebody died or whenever the killer was shown?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#39;s good? Well, there is an impressive suspense scene where the killer walks underneath swamp waters to get to his victims and a tense sequence where the final girl must camouflage herself with bunch of other dead bodies while the killer looks on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other than that, It&#39;s another August/September disappointment. I was looking forward to it, but I did not get what was expected.&#34;
b&#39;Role-reversal remake of 1942\&#39;s &#34;The Major and the Minor&#34; has Jerry Lewis stepping into the part originally played by Ginger Rogers, but unfortunately this anemic outing is missing a lot more than just Ginger. Lewis attempts to pass for a child when boarding a train; he\&#39;s successful, but the deception leads to a string of comic and romantic confusions. Sidney Sheldon adapted the screenplay, tossing in musical moments for Dean Martin (playing yet another in his stable of second-bananas) and a jewel-robbery subplot (which is dire). Diana Lynn, who played the wily teenager in the original film, plays Lewis\&#39; love-interest here. She\&#39;s cute; Jerry isn\&#39;t. *1/2 from ****&#39;
b&#34;Hello it is I Derrick Cannon and I welcome you to the first ever Cannonite review show. My movie for this week was debatable, what route what movie, what excellent four star epic would I choose, guess what I decided to pull a one eighty and go the other route, I&#39;ve decided to review a movie so atrocious that it totally killed what could have been a very unique concept. The movie I will review today is Jack Frost Two revenge of the mutant killer snowman. The Stars in this movie include Christopher Allport as Sam Tiller, Eileen Seeley as Anne Tiller, Marsha Clark as Marla David Allen Brooks as Agent Manners, Sean Patrick Murphy as Captain Fun, Ray Cooney as the Colonel and Scott MacDonald as the killer snowman himself Jack Frost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s hard to believe that this movie was in the same series that gave us the incredibly funny Jack Frost(loved the carrot scene),but it&#39;s even harder to believe that this is the exact same cast. The movie was ruined for me as soon as they arrived on the island and Captain Fun was introduced. What was the point of his character and how did he fit into a horror movie?The only possible reason I could see was that they wanted to give us a character that was total killer snowman fodder. Sam Tiler seemed more paranoid then he did in the original, his babbling about anti freeze was one of the most pathetic display I had seen in a movie. His wife however was one of the few bright spots. She played her role as the main woman to a hilt. She was a voice of reason in film of pure idiocy. The scene where she figures out how to kill the snowmen was one of the most anticipated parts of the movie. Ray MacDonald once again did a great job as Jack Frost despite what he was given. If it wasn&#39;t for such weak characters he could have been immortalized like Chucky,Freddy and Jason. Laugh if you must but when it comes down to it Jack Frost had spunk, he had humor, and most importantly he had an undoubtable vicious streak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie could have been so much more, it could have been a continuation of a great franchise, instead any plans to make a Jack Frost three have been canceled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie gets a two out of ten for me, and it&#39;s lucky that it even gets a one.&#34;
b&#34;Taran Adarsh a reputed critic praised such a dubba movie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film has a weird story wherein a lover sells his love to a brothel cos he wants money to save his mother and then also gets forgived for it LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is crap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the entire first half has it&#39;s focus on romance, comedy which fails to work The twist shocks but the entire second half is a mess and the climax is clich\xc3\xa9d&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Direction by Aditya Datt is bad Music is typical Himesh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emraan does his serious role well but his wardrobe, his way of walking through songs.etc is similar to his previous films Geeta Bhasra annoys Ashmith Patel fails to convince this actor was good in MURDER only so far and then a downhill Mithun some screen time and he is okay but his breaking down into a song is forced Ranjeet is okay&#34;
b&#39;If you ever visited Shenandoah Acres as a child and wondered, could there be a worse vacation spot in the world? Well, you could have watched this movie and had your answer. Flavia (a.k.a. Fistula) Macintyre\&#39;s dude ranch is often frequented by business casual Gordon, at least since resident water witch, Jessica, was 13. But Jessica can find much more than fresh spring water with that divining rod \xc2\x96 buried &#34;tray-shure,&#34; lost jewelry, dead bodies, even a talisman that will keep her from dressing like a slut and raising drinks with a phony beat and a Suzanne Pleshette look-alike while hypnotized by a disembodied head. Evil, evil evil.&#39;
b&#34;Sure, you get to see some boobies, but if that&#39;s all you&#39;re looking for in a film, you get more mileage from youtube. I just paid a dollar from redbox because I saw Val Kilmer&#39;s name. Bad move. Plot didn&#39;t thicken, dialogue was shoddy, characters undeveloped at best. Somebody said cinematography was alright but don&#39;t expect too much. This movie moved very slow and ended without grace. Blacklist. I spent much of the movie wondering if some event or color scheme of things was symbolic. I never actually rewound to figure it out because nothing was ever explained in the end. No twists. It also left many questions that as it turns out, I had no desire to hear answered. One of the worst movies I have ever seen.&#34;
b&#39;...the first? Killjoy 1. But here\&#39;s the review of Killjoy 2:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(contains spoilers, so beware readers)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh my. Oh, my, my, my. I\&#39;ll start off with telling you that I had no hopes in the least bit that this movie would be good. Considering that Killjoy (the first movie) is without a doubt the worst movie ever made, the sequel didn\&#39;t have much promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As expected, it didn\&#39;t deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deaths were even lamer than in the first movie. There was absolutely no eye candy whatsoever, and every single prop looked so fake that I wouldn\&#39;t be surprised if they had a kindergarten class make them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, I don\&#39;t even know where to begin. Hm, for starters, the movie wasn\&#39;t even feature length. It was only an hour and eight minutes long (68 min.), but then again, ending it early was actually a reprieve. In fact, that\&#39;s the only reason that this movie wasn\&#39;t as bad as the first, because the first was longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually, I don\&#39;t give spoilers in reviews, but since I don\&#39;t want any of you to go through the torture of watching this waste of film, I\&#39;m going to spoil away. Not that there\&#39;s much to spoil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let\&#39;s start with the ending. KILLJOY IS THE PUSSIEST KILLER EVER. It takes explosions, firebombs, guns, etc. to kill all of the normal serial killers in horror movies. Guess what it took to kill Killjoy? A F***ING GLASS OF WATER. No lie. In the end, a girl picked up a cup of water and threw the water on Killjoy\&#39;s face. Then Killjoy started screaming, and they tried to make it look like his face was melting by putting dried rubber cement on his forehead. Then he laid there, and the people went to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let\&#39;s hit the acting. VERY TERRIBLE. Not even one person was believable in the least bit. I don\&#39;t even know what to say, other than it looks like they just hired a few hobos living on the streets to act in this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I honestly doubt that they spent any more than 100 dollars total to make this movie. They had nothing. Most of it took place in the woods, which wouldn\&#39;t have cost them anything to film on. The actors weren\&#39;t giving in any effort whatsoever, so it\&#39;s blatant that they were probably &#34;working&#34; for free. They didn\&#39;t have any kind of special effects or nice props, and they probably used ketchup for the blood. Hell, who am I kidding? They probably didn\&#39;t even spend 100 dollars. They probably spent $3.29 on a bottle of ketchup and that was it. A f**kin\&#39; movie made with a budget of $3.29.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Bob\&#39;s sake, they couldn\&#39;t even afford to rent a cop uniform. In the end, after Killjoy dies, the girl wakes up and says &#34;Where is he?&#34; and the main woman replies, &#34;He\&#39;s gone.&#34; Then, suddenly, some fat goofy guy with scars on his face pops out of nowhere with a cell phone saying &#34;You have a phone call.&#34; The girl answers and says &#34;Oh, hi mom!&#34; and smiles. Then the fat goofy guy walks along to reveal that it\&#39;s a police officer. However, he\&#39;s wearing khaki pants, and a regular button up green shirt, with a lame badge on the front pocket. Hell, it was probably the badge that the director got when he was in safety patrol in 3rd grade. Then they all got into a tan blazer and drove off as the credits rolled. They couldn\&#39;t even get a police cruiser so they just got a tan blazer. F**kin\&#39; lame. Killjoy didn\&#39;t even have the ice cream van that he had in the first movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Killjoy is without a doubt the most flamboyantly gay slasher EVER. If there was a slasher that wore hot pink spandex and carried a rainbow flag, he STILL would not be as gay as Killjoy. Killjoy isn\&#39;t funny either (and believe me, he DID try to be).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing about this movie is an extremely lame threat given by one of the delinquents. Somebody makes a comment to some boy about not passing third grade, to which the boy responds, &#34;I\&#39;ll show you third grade!&#34; in a threatening manner. That has to be the absolute worst threat that I\&#39;ve ever heard. &#34;I\&#39;ll show you third grade!&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie doesn\&#39;t even work on a &#34;so bad, it\&#39;s good&#34; level. It\&#39;s filth. Unless you did something bad, and you are feeling so guilty about it that you want to punish yourself severely, DON\&#39;T watch this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember; if a flaming homosexual clown with a huge black afro tries to bore you to death with gay jokes (and attempt to kill you at the same time), just throw some water at him. Case closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL RATING: .1 out of 10&#39;
b&#39;I think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toilet-paper. No respect whatsoever to many important details which intrinsically make the movie. For example, the names of some Serbian terrorists (that I remember) are Caradan Maldic, Ivanic Loyvek and Leo Hasse. What kind of names are that? Certainly not Serbian! By the way, Caradan Maldic!!! What a name, I laughed for days thinking about it. Probably an implication on Karadzic and Mladic. Secondly, there have never been any cases of terrorism done by Serbians. A journalist like the main character ought to have known that. Thirdly, the actors playing Serbian terrorists are not even Serbs nor do they speak Serbo-croatian. All this aside, this movie is solidly acted but the story is paper-thin and full of holes. At times it makes no sense whatsoever!!!&#39;
b&#39;It is sad to have to say that a film is truly awful and one tries to find ways around saying this. However, this is a dreadful film. Gene Hackman wastes time (and one suspects, many dollars) on re-playing his most famous, and oft recreated, role as &#34;Gene Hackman&#34;. Otherwise, television actors are given the chance to become film stars, and successfully, resist the temptation. Patrick Swayze has a minor part and went on to greater things, for which he must be eternally thankful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched this film, as a result of someone else\&#39;s review and I felt that another point of view was merited. You may not agree with my review but now, at least, you have been warned.&#39;
b&#34;Peter Crawford discovers a comet on a collision course with the moon. But when the government doesn&#39;t believe him (dumb fact #1). He builds a shelter in deep underground and is drawing lots to see who will go. Plus is willing to kill to save humanity (dumb fact #2). With millions of dollars of technology, how could a civilian see what NASA could not? Plus, the ends justifies the means moral of this story is just plain WRONG!!! This movie is improbable and totally unbelievable. What was running through these people minds, why the hell do crap piles like this get the green light? Some times I wonder who someone has to **** to get a movie made in this ****ing town.&#34;
b&#39;At first sight, I must say already, watch The Contractor, 2007. With Wesley Snipes too. A better action movie and with a more dramatic plot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Detonator has an horrendous plot focusing in some sort of atomic bomb, set in Romania and with awful directing for an action movie-- there is no thrilling moments and an action movie is turned in to boredom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, what you expect Wesley Snipes to do, when awful screenplays like this one are offered to him? Don\&#39;t blame him, he needs the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first impression when I saw the movie, 3 years ago. But I won\&#39;t see it again, no way. Screw it. It sucks. There. I said it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I don\&#39;t think I ever said &#34;this movie sucks&#34; on a IMDb review. Thank you, Detonator!&#39;
b&#34;This movie sucks. It&#39;s horrible. If anyone liked it, those people should get there heads examined. Jackie Mason&#39;s character sounds like a retard. That guy who tries to kill the gopher is a loser and he sucked. Even though Chevy Chase was in this movie, he wasn&#39;t funny. This movie had crude and unfunny jokes and did not have Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight, and Bill Murray. Even though Jackie Mason&#39;s character had the personality of Rodney Dangerfield&#39;s character, Mason&#39;s character sucks. Rodney Dangerfield was funny! He should have returned! I don&#39;t care about Ted Knight, but Bill Murray should have returned, also. The original Caddyshack was Murray&#39;s career performance. If he was funny in the first, he could have been funny in the second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final comment: I recommend this movie to... NO ONE!!!!!!!! THIS MOVIE SUCKED!!!! IT HAS SUCKED, IT SUCKS NOW, AND IT WILL ALWAYS SUCK!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/10&#34;
b&#34;I felt like I was watching an example of how not to make a movie. I think the director filmed it in his back yard! There was no real plot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible acting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst production I have ever witnessed. A couple of bad CG effects and then the rest of the movies was spent walking around in what looked like a junk yard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t normally write reviews to movies but was moved to warn everyone about this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life is to short to waste your time with this movie!&#34;
b&#34;I honestly fail to understand why people love this show so much. A friend of mine watches this and since I like sci-fi, I tried to watch along since the plot of the show sounded promising, but in truth it really is a very boring show. The only thing that will keep you awake during this show are the video game-like CGI-effects and the complete overuse of muppets. Note that I call it muppets because they actually really look like muppets, not like the aliens they should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of which; the muppets and make-up effects are horribly overused in this show. You have this guy who could be best described as a alien/dwarf-hybrid, you have a pale girl who looks like a cheesy vamp-girl, you&#39;ve got a floating potty-mouth frog-alien... It just feels very unnecessary and furthermore even to the point that you feel distracted from the whole storyline about a lost astronaut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every episode is also too much of a stand-alone. The creators of this show directed this in such a way that every episode almost feels like a whole other show. At least up until the point that you see the main-characters/muppets again, that is. The whole plot about the main-character getting back to earth is way to much pushed to the background at points. The acting is also quite bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: if you want good sci-fi, just look somewhere else. This isn&#39;t even real sci-fi to begin with in my opinion, since the show is more aimed at fantasy-elements with all the puppetry and weird dreams going on. And if you just want to see muppets then I suggest you watch the Muppet Show and feel glad that this abomination of a show has come to a end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way; doesn&#39;t anyone have dejavu&#39;s with the concept of a living spaceship? Ohyeah thats right; Doctor Who started that concept almost about 30 years ago! This show is like a collection of &#39;sci-fi&#39; leftovers. Scripts and events that were abandoned for a good reason, only to be picked up by this horrible show.&#34;
b&#39;Filmed in Arizona by a mostly-foreign crew, &#34;Nightkill&#34; is one of the clumsiest crime dramas I have ever seen. Robert Mitchum (in a cowboy hat) trails recently-widowed Jaclyn Smith around, hoping to figure out if she had a hand in her husband\&#39;s death. Jaclyn\&#39;s wardrobe is of the Dale Evans variety and her dog is named &#34;Cowboy&#34;...seems as if somebody sure bought into the American myth that all westerners talk and dress like descendants of John Wayne! Screenplay by Joan Andre and John Case may have worked better if approached as parody; this mystery thriller just plays tame, with director Ted Post asleep at the controls. Don\&#39;t be drawn in by the video box art of Jaclyn screaming while taking a shower. She does indeed take a shower in this film, but it is not revealing (nor does it further the murky plot one iota). NO STARS from ****&#39;
b&#39;****Contains Spoilers****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a fan of Rachael Leigh Cook, I watched for this show to finally come on so that I could see it. I taped it so I could watch it several times, and there is something about this show that really bothers me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recognize that this was a made-for-TV movie. Not only that, but it was made for Lifetime, which is a channel that I despise. Because it was made for TV, I can ignore the huge plot holes. I can ignore the massive lack of character development in Ally Sheedy\&#39;s character. I can overlook the fact that George C. Scott and Rachael Leigh Cook, both of whom are very talented actors, were definately not reaching the best of their abilities. I can look past the fact that Don Diamont\&#39;s character was so cliche\&#39;d, that you knew when you saw him he was the villain. I can even pass over the obvious mistake in the timeline (She\&#39;s raped during her winter break, and then over a year later she has the baby from it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major thing that I can\&#39;t get over is this: There are two trials for the custody of the child. In the first trial, custody is awarded to the child\&#39;s father because he is &#34;better educated, has a degree from a community college, and has a full time job.&#34; In the second trial the judgement is reversed because the Judge feels that there is lack of evidence that Emma (RLC\&#39;s character)is an unfit mother, and custody shouldn\&#39;t be taken from the primary caretaker and given to someone with no previous interaction with the child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is this: Nowhere during the course of these trials is the fact that a thirtysomthing year old man raped a 15 year old girl and got her pregnant taken into consideration! Whether it was a rape or not, he had sex with a minor! Wouldn\&#39;t that be taken into consideration when the judge is choosing him for custody because he\&#39;s a &#34;mature adult?&#34; Mature adults don\&#39;t have sex with minors! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s not the worst cable movie that you would ever see, but it\&#39;s not a great show either. ** out of ****&#39;
b&#39;If you\&#39;ve seen Atlantis 1, then you\&#39;d know that what made that film truly great was brilliant animation and a good script. This movie was SO sloppily drawn and animated. The story is also dopey. I was so disappointed in this half-baked drivel that I couldn\&#39;t make it past the first hour, and MAN did I try! The one thing this film had was that it expanded the &#34;mole&#34; character, making him both more sympathetic and three dimensional. Take it from me, judge this junk from the cover on the video box. The cover is poorly drawn Disney schlock, clearly grabbing for an easy buck from an unsuspecting parent. If this was a stand alone flick, it wouldn\&#39;t be so bad, but riding on the coattails of a brilliant piece like Atlantis makes it utterly inexcuseable.&#39;
b&#39;The Adventures of Sebastian Cole is about a boy named Sebastian (Adrian Grenier) who fancies himself becoming a writer at some point, given he actually puts effort into it. This movie is presumably the years where he gets his material for writing, the adventure years, hence the title and the previous quote. In it we experience the very typical coming of age stories and warnings of loves, drugs, and sex...changes. Yeah, there\&#39;s a slight twist here that is very interesting, and that is that Sebastian\&#39;s step dad (Clark Gregg) very early on makes a rough decision to get a sex-change that has a huge impact on Sebastian\&#39;s family and his relationship with his step-dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clark Gregg plays Hank/Henrietta, Sebastian\&#39;s step-father and is very good in the part, very believable without being over the top, which is a route this film could\&#39;ve taken rather easily. Thankfully they didn\&#39;t. Adrien Grenier, who I\&#39;m only familiar with from Entourage, is also very good in his part as Sebastian, and together, he and Gregg have a great relationship on screen. It\&#39;s always quite engaging to watch these guys (?) relationship as it develops and is genuinely heartbreaking at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that\&#39;s the best of what this film has to offer. Unfortunately, it brings with it some mediocre camera work, direction, and cinematography. It\&#39;s not bad, but it\&#39;s a far cry from being good, or memorable in the slightest. The characters are also thinly written, and it\&#39;s clear from the get go how most of the arcs will pan out. The only truly fascinating character through and through is Clark Gregg\&#39;s Hank/Henrietta. I\&#39;ve already said Grenier did well acting-wise, but the character of Sebastian is not only not engaging, but is completely unlikeable. I don\&#39;t honestly see why anyone in the audience would route for his character in anything he does. He mopes, whines, cheats, lies, and lacks any aspirations other than to be a complete slacker. It\&#39;d be different if he was maybe a side-character or comic relief, but to have him as the main focus and to be asked to take the character seriously? Come on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I don\&#39;t really hold it against this film, but I just want to say...pick a different song in all these films, Hollywood! No more &#34;Where Is My Mind&#34; by the Pixies, we all know it\&#39;s a good song, stop using it in every other film!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I could just keep tearing more and more of this film apart, but in all honesty I didn\&#39;t hate it. I just didn\&#39;t really care for it, and I wouldn\&#39;t recommend it to anyone. The Adventures of Sebastian Cole isn\&#39;t a bad or boring film, it\&#39;s just not a very good or engaging one either. It\&#39;s very uneven and the script could\&#39;ve used quite a bit of work. I guess the point of the film is to be a loose sort of look at the life of a writer before he made it, and it worked...if that writer put out pieces of fiction that I wouldn\&#39;t want to read.&#39;
b&#39;There is a difference between a &#34;film,&#34; and a &#34;movie.&#34; A film, regardless of quality, is ready for public consumption. A movie is what a group of friends gets together to make over the course of a weekend with a camcorder. In my time as a viewer, I have seen may examples of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On September 19, I attended a screening of writer/director Jon Satejowski\&#39;s &#34;Donnybrook.&#34; Now having read the script and having seen two different cuts (a rough cut and the &#34;finished&#34; product) of this piece, I can safely say it is a movie. And a student movie, at that. It is, for lack of a better word, competent, which is to say, the director knew how to push record on a camera and capture moving images. The visuals are, for the most part, static and unimpressive, and dialog scenes are reduced to mostly long shots, with little to no close up shots to allow the audience to establish a relationship with the characters. I understand that this is a modestly budgeted film, but some visual flair would have been appreciated, and it would have gone a long way toward keeping the audience interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, there have been independent pictures that have shown that limited camera work can be over come with well a well written, engrossing story and some sharp dialog. Steven Soderbergh\&#39;s &#34;sex, lies, and videotape&#34; comes immediately to mind. This movie, however, has neither. The main story is weak and unfocused. If the main plot is Davie trying to mend his relationship with his father, then I feel this movie misses the point. What I got out of it is that Davie\&#39;s main aspiration is to &#34;change the face of rock \&#39;n\&#39; roll.&#34; However, we see very little activity on his part to show this. While there is one dream sequence at the beginning, and an impromptu performance of his at the end, all we seem to get are scenes of Davie listening to music or casually strumming a guitar. We are simply told that Davie has played a lot of gigs, but we never see him in full rock out mode. Next time, SHOW don\&#39;t TELL the audience. Anyone who has taken a creative writing class knows this. Also, Davie doesn\&#39;t look like someone that would have been big in the glam rock era of the 1970\&#39;s; he looks like he\&#39;d be more comfortable in the early days of rock \&#39;n\&#39; roll, posing as James Dean\&#39;s less talented brother. In the meantime, the rest of the movies events seem to happen at random to rather clich\xc3\xa9 characters, and story threads, that have little or nothing to do with the slim main story, are brought up and abandoned with alarming frequency (i.e. the subplot involving Terry\&#39;s father). If I want to see a film with this kind of haphazard construction, I will consider watching &#34;Napolean Dynamite&#34; again, a film I could barely make it through the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the above mentioned dialog scenes, I guess I should mention that they are few and extremely far between. Is it too much to ask for characters who do speak? I don\&#39;t think it is. When the characters do speak, it is in short, choppy sentences; collections of oh so insightful questions, angered grunts or wildly over-the-top outbursts. These characters simply do not behave like normal, rational people. Working with material like this, it is easy to understand why there is only one good performance in the film, Al Hudson\&#39;s, and that\&#39;s just because he\&#39;s doing a poor imitation of Sam Elliott for his time on screen. A good director, or at least one who is ready for the challenge of a feature director, would have been able to spot these problems and get the writer and camera people to correct them. However, with Satejowski being so close to the material, he simply doesn\&#39;t see them, or, if he does, he is unwilling to take the necessary steps to fix them because it\&#39;ll hurt his creative vision. Being unable or unwilling to deal with criticism in a constructive manner, is the mark of a self-indulgent, misguided fool. Just ask Rob Schneider. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, we are left with a poor, high-school-set, knock-off of Zach Braff\&#39;s amazing &#34;Garden State&#34; combined with the equally amazing &#34;Velvet Goldmine,&#34; two films far more worthy of your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now before any of the cast or crew come out of the word work to take me to task for this review, allow me to offer this. The best I can do is compliment Mr. Satejowski for having the ambition to make a film of his own and to put it out there for an audience to see. However, the hopes that this movie will be picked up and distributed are simply deluded visions of grandeur. This is a student movie, nothing more, nothing less. If the movie holds any promise (and let\&#39;s face it, at this point, it isn\&#39;t going to come from the acting, writing, or directing), it is this: If, IF, the people associated with this film are willing, then, please, learn from this movie, file it away, and use the lessons learned on your next attempt; don\&#39;t attack your critics, or have friend or family do it for you. If you are able to do this, maybe the next one will be worthy of distribution, worthy of being called a &#34;film.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am your audience, and I am willing to watch.&#39;
b&#39;Dire! Dismal! Awful! Laughable! Disappointing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right, your trapped in &#34;The Cave&#34; with several &#34;hard&#34; Men and a Woman or two, your being systematically killed by &#34;Something&#34; and you STILL don\&#39;t get to hear ANY naughty Grown Up words!!! A 15 Cert\&#39; here in England, and you could tell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Egos of the &#34;Macho Men&#34; was just too much, pass the bucket I\&#39;m going to be sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie should never be exposed to daylight and ironically, be kept in the darkest, deepest hole in the ground and be forgotten forever. I have a feeling that this description isn\&#39;t the first time to pop its his head from a hole in the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like the film The Cube, it looked like a good concept but was just let down at the last post by, well its self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Comment contains Spoilers alright, its called The Cave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Bruce.&#39;
b&#34;Macbeth is one of the most frequently told stories in cinema and has been translated many times in numerous theater and celluloid settings. Originally written by William Shakespeare in the early 1600&#39;s, Macbeth tells the story of betrayal among royalty and one man&#39;s quest for power. Director Geoffrey Wright (Romper Stomper) tries his hand at updating Macbeth by setting it in the contemporary Melbourne underworld. A film where the characters substitute swords for guns (ala Baz Luhrman&#39;s Romeo and Juliet) and royal vassals for gangsters, Macbeth is a gritty, violent, but critically flawed film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Macbeth (Sam Worthington)works for King Duncan (Gary Sweet). After being elevated to the Thane of Glamis by The King (as was prophesied to Macbeth by three witches), Macbeth starts setting his eyes on the throne. One night the King comes to stay at Macbeth&#39;s house and Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hill) talks him into killing The King to assume power. Macbeth kills his master and then assumes his crown. But success has it&#39;s downside, as Macbeth soon finds out, when he has to go to hideous lengths to protect his murderous secret. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, first things first. The film&#39;s major fault is Sam Worthington. His portrayal of Macbeth is in a word... boring. I honestly didn&#39;t care about Macbeth while watching the film. I had more sympathy for Victoria Hill&#39;s Lady Macbeth because she bothered to act at least. Worthington sits sullen and wood faced throughout the entire film. I felt like he was doing his best impression of Johnny Deep&#39;s George Jung character from Blow... but without the charisma. I have never seen Worthington in a film before so I&#39;m not sure if it was his or the Director&#39;s fault, but either way the glue that should have tied everything together into one cohesive unit is weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dialog is good, but when matched up to the Geoffrey Wright&#39;s Australian Gangster Motif seems a bit out of place. Frentically paced action sequences mixed with long Shaksperian musings creates pacing conflict within the film. I understand that this is Macbeth and that the director wanted to use the original dialog intact. But hard, fast action scenes following a three minute soliloquy tends to get annoying if not a bit pretentious. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The camera-work is highly stylized, and for the most part, it works well. One thing that I found annoying was how the camera would slowly jostle back and forth, almost constantly. I don&#39;t mind shots like that it&#39;s just overdone. It&#39;s passes beyond the realm of being cool and stylish and instead becomes irritating. Other than that, the art direction and cinematography is fairly well-done. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all of the good qualities Macbeth possesses; stylish direction, Shakespearian dialog, a strong soundtrack, supernatural nude witches(the weird sisters), and good helpings of brutal, bloody violence. All of these strengths are forgotten when one considers Sam Worthington&#39;s uninspired portrayal of Macbeth. The role of Macbeth was essential for tying everything together and in this respect Geoffrey Wright and Sam Worthington failed miserably, making Macbeth a forgettable foray into Shakespeare.&#34;
b&#39;&#34;Shadows and Fog&#34; is surely one of Woody Allen\&#39;s weakest films, right up there with &#34;September&#34; and &#34;Hollywood Ending&#34; (though nothing Allen has done equals the awfulness of &#34;Anything Else&#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Shadows and Fog&#34; is Allen\&#39;s homage to the German Expressionist style of film-making, all stark and stylized light and shadow and...you guessed it.....lots of fog. But you can tell Allen got caught up in the technique and the parody and forgot to make a movie that anyone would care about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, he made &#34;Husbands and Wives&#34; the same year, so things weren\&#39;t a total wash for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: D&#39;
b&#34;Homecoming; what a HUGE disappointment!! After reading the plot summary (the dead coming back to vote - AGAINST George W. Bush!!!!!) I couldn&#39;t wait to see this. It started off interesting and it immediately caught my attention. Unfortunately, though, it slowly descended into a boring political satire that I didn&#39;t need to see (I can just watch some good old Aussie comedy for that!). There was pretty much only one or two scenes of horror and they weren&#39;t even that scary. I couldn&#39;t believe this came from Joe Dante, who could easily have pulled it off with an equal balance of thrills and satire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst episode so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/5.&#34;
b&#39;42/100. Often referred as &#34;Tarzan with clothes on&#34;, but it\&#39;s not at all in the same league as his far superior Tarzan series. Basically, The Jungle Jim series became a Tarzan replacement for Johnny Weismuller, after he started getting too out of shape for a loincloth. In Jungle Jim, he is fully clothed. It can\&#39;t compare to the Tarzan series in any way, not in acting, screenplays or quality of production. It\&#39;s pretty hokey stuff. This one is the first the best in the series, and that isn\&#39;t saying much. Too much stock footage is used, and it is so obvious. The score is overdone, and the plot is lame and the production is so poor it makes it hard to watch at times.&#39;
b&#39;In &#34;Red Letters&#34;, Coyote is at the vortex of as a college professor who writes to a female prison inmate and gets more than he bargained for. There are two reasons to watch this flick...Kinski is one and Piven the other although it\&#39;s difficult for their sparks to shine in such a complete directorial disaster. Everything is wrong with &#34;Red Letters&#34;...convoluted, lousy screenplay, camera, editing, and most of all acting which is subpar for Coyote, etc. Battersby has taken a story with potential and turned it into a seriously flawed and amateurish flick not worth the time.&#39;
b&#39;When I read the reviews of Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye, I thought, &#34;Huh?&#34;. It was THAT confusing. To be sure, I went to watch the film and what do you know? It\&#39;s a remake of &#34;The Wedding Singer&#34;. Several scenes have been changed to suit the whole essence of Indianness, but the rest of it is a direct lift from the 1998 Hollywood hit. Bollywood is no stranger to remakes, but this is one so poor that it pains me just to watch it. I groaned so much watching this and I realized I wasn\&#39;t the only one doing so! One guy actually walked out of the theater and never came back! Salman Khan should seriously stop doing comedy roles. He shrieks and whines too much. Why can\&#39;t he just take it easy? He doesn\&#39;t do justice to the role originally acted out by Adam Sandler. He doesn\&#39;t have Sandler\&#39;s sense of comic timing. Rani is a wonderful actress and one of my favorites, but she\&#39;s no Drew Barrymore either. The scene where she stands in front of a mirror practicing to say her new surname (&#34;Hi, I\&#39;m Mrs Pugalia&#34;) doesn\&#39;t match up to Barrymore\&#39;s version (&#34;Hi, I\&#39;m Mrs Julia Gulia&#34;). I felt embarrassed watching that scene, even though I had loved the original. The music is not too bad. It\&#39;s probably the only saving grace of this otherwise horrible film! Avoid this at all cost!&#39;
b&#39;First Off, I am a huge fan of Robert Blake, always have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie came on Movieplex last night 10/13, and the title interested me &amp; of course the star. But after watching it I was left more confused than I was before it started.... There are some good scenes, and I thought they would lead somewhere, but they didn\&#39;t, it turned out to be an &#34;anti-cop&#34; &#34;anti-buddy&#34; &#34;anti-hippie&#34;, pretty much &#34;anti-everything movie&#34;, with an extremely confusing plot that also went nowhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Blake is great as the lead, well as great as someone could be with this bad movie, I am still a huge fan of Mr. Blake and love his acting even in crap like this...But this drug induced 70\&#39;s tripe, well... better stay away from this one...And, that ending, what a pisser.&#39;
b&#34;OK, this movie wasn&#39;t good at all. Video games aren&#39;t what I would brag on if I was over the age of 15. Cool to play games, but writing a comment about video game players may like this movie for that it is, that is strange. Just play a video game, don&#39;t make up a sorry story about getting trapped in one. I use my cell phone, I hope I don&#39;t loose my girlfriend in that. Grease being the worst ever? OK, Grease has a very well thought out story along with being a musical. Even if you don&#39;t like musicals, anyone would say Grease is good. My brother plays video games all the time and he watched 30 minutes and left because it was so awful. I feel asleep.&#34;
b&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the process of boring you with the wordy, rambling storyline and the complete absence of character development, it manages to enforce a few negative black stereotypes out there. At one point I was wondering if Jesse Helms co-wrote the screenplay.&#39;
b&#39;I rented this movie from a local library without having any prior knowledge of the book it is based on or the movie itself, purely based on the chance that it\&#39;s one of those rare, overlooked gems that one can discover from time to time and really enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this is not one of those movies. I am not sure if this is a movie driven by sentimentality or worse, deliberate agenda, but certain elements of it made it impossible to immerse. It is supposed to portray a struggling immigrant worker community which tries to cope with the difficult realities of their life. That is a fine premise and it could have made for a gripping story, but the execution just made me alternate between getting annoyed and amused at the ridiculousness of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we have a community of simple farm workers who migrated to the US in search of employment and who get used and abused repeatedly by evil white men. And when I say evil - I mean EVIL. All white people in this movie are sinful, racist, sadistic, abusive devils whose sole purpose in life is sexual depravity intertwined with exploiting the poor immigrants. It would be a sad story if it wasn\&#39;t so unintentionally grotesque and therefore hilarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The portrayal of the immigrants is also a poster-worthy example of exaggeration except that it goes in the opposite direction. The immigrants are saintly, clean and could serve as ointment for boo-boos and ouies the world over. I couldn\&#39;t help but laugh when I saw these &#34;field workers&#34; presumably digging in the ditches all day with their notoriously clean clothes and chiseled hair cuts from a top notch hair salon. A little restraint and a more unbiased hand at the helm could have made this a much better movie evoking some intended emotion rather than sarcastic snickers.&#39;
b&#39;This really is a cringe making exercise. Dressed up as a tribute to fire fighters it contain stupid scenes of &#34;we\&#39;re just a bunch of wacky guys&#34; in the midst of the &#34;my goodness this can be really dangerous&#34; parts. Mostly it is just plain dumb. You couldn\&#39;t believe for a single minute that real fire fighters act like this. It is so awful I couldn\&#39;t bear to watch at times. If my daughter hadn\&#39;t rented it and then insisted on seeing it through to the end I would have had no option but to turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thing is I\&#39;m a John Travolta fan. Every interview of his I\&#39;ve seen just raises my opinion of him. I think this was one strictly for the money. I\&#39;m sure he\&#39;ll be happy when this one gets forgotten.&#39;
b&#34;A heist film with Jean Reno, Matt Damon and Laurence Fishburne... sounds great on paper? I suspect it must have done when someone green lighted the production of this movie but the end product is terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is dull, the action boring, and, for a film that is only 88 minutes it seems to just drag on. I could feel my life slipping away and was sure there was something better I should have been doing... any paint to watch dry somewhere perhaps?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigh. I&#39;m a huge fan of Jean Reno, but what on earth was he thinking when he signed up to this? There are so many other great action movies around... go watch one of those and let this movie be best forgotten.&#34;
b&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie really has nothing going for it. With the Reverend played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman complaining about his constipation and other toilet humor in a 2.5 hour movie, you know that they made no cuts at all and left the crap in, literally. It&#39;s a waste of good talent, and a total embarrassment. Dreadful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;
b&#34;The first time I watched this movie I was ten years old. I thought it was bad then, and at that age I had no cinematic taste whatsoever. I watched this movie on Cinemax about 3 days ago and was reminded why I hated the movie in the first place. Madonna&#39;s character, Nikki, is annoying and obnoxious. There&#39;s no way that the main character would ever fall in love with her. The jokes were corny and the dialogue was worse than a t.v. soap opera!! I&#39;m glad that I didn&#39;t see this movie at the theatre, or rent it. I feel bad for my parents who had to endure watching it with me! Madonna is not necessarily a bad actress, but in this role she is portrayed as a complete idiot.&#34;
b&#39;Shakespeare would have been outraged. The writers mutilated Shakespeare\&#39;s amazing work. Ariel is the only believable acting performance. The African voodoo, secluded swamp, and &#34;Gator Man&#34; character make the movie a mockery of Shakespeare\&#39;s true Tempest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t waste your eye-sight on this movie.&#39;
b&#34;OK I for one thought the trailer was quite good so was hopeful for this film, plus with the cast line up I was sure it couldn&#39;t get less than a 6 in my books. However I got annoyed half hour into the story... just where normal films get good, this film hit rock bottom. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPOILER * The guy who everyone is trying to help is so caring of other people getting hurt in the middle of the hustle that he turns on his colleagues to save a tramp and then locks himself inside one of the armoured trucks. Not only that, he constantly tries to get other peoples attention by which he ends up endangering more people and long story short, the outcome is that he is responsible for not just the tramps death, but also a police officer getting shot and the kidnapping of his younger brother... oh and all 5 of his colleagues dying disgraced deaths. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the end he is HAPPY because he came to his senses halfway through the endeavour, so what if all his colleagues are now dead rather than sticking to the plan and being a millionaire. This film tried to be so politically correct it makes me sick! Ruined a good story. Shame really.&#34;
b&#34;Visually beautiful with some fine music, this film otherwise has a fairly trite made-for-TV quality. The romance between two characters, which spans a cultural and educational divide, is simply NOT plausible. Of course, from early on we knew our persnickety heroine would lighten up, win over the locals, and find true love, but that doesn&#39;t make it any less woeful that the movie had to take such completely expected turns. This film had lots of promise, which makes it more of a shame that the promise was unrealized. Perhaps a nice under-the-blanket on a cold night freebie on cable, but I certainly wouldn&#39;t recommend paid rental or purchase. I&#39;m sure the soundtrack is wonderful, though.&#34;
b&#34;I love watching steven seagal movies not because of the action of the great plot holes but just because it makes me laugh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh it makes me laugh so hard this movie totally got no point and is ridiculous compared to this movie Pearl harbor rocks!!! and Ben affleck need no acting school at all just to give a impression how bad it is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first off all there so many goofs and bad acting its just getting worse like when steven is try to get out of jail a chopper lands at first the security notice and they led them land when they fly away all of the sudden a guard start shooting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or when he killed that guy in the car he and treach both walk away you can&#39;t see no oil on the ground behind him steven notice that there is oil without even watching treach trows a lighter and the car blows up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and there are plenty of more goofs Steven uses his basic action when someone is pointing a gun at him he grabs it and shoot him totally bullshit!!! like some gangster would let that ever happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the acting is also very worse at the fight scene in the jail outdoor place you can see steven clearly wait to come in action just rewind it a couple of time and you notice the bad acting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its just makes me laugh i hope one day it comes to the cinema&#39;s here in Holland then i&#39;ll go there with as many friends as possible just to laugh my self to death&#34;
b&#39;This is a very strange product from Hollywood. Apparently it didn\&#39;t test well because actors who have footage in the credits have been edited completely out of the movie, which means a hasty cut job was done on it. It feels like it was wrestled out of the usually competent Demme\&#39;s hands, and just thrown away. On the other and it is so totally lacking in substance that maybe nothing could save it. It has no real center, either narratively or time wise. Although it says the running time is 92 minutes, I seem to recall it ending abruptly, around the 80 minute mark. It\&#39;s over before it even gets going. It\&#39;s pretty much laugh free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The merits of the &#34;Matthew Modine picture&#34; were as elusive then as the Luke Wilson picture is now.&#39;
b&#39;I love old &#34;monster movies&#34; for the pure camp value. This one does not disappoint if you find that sort of thing amusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is pure 1950s stilted crap. You do get used to it when you\&#39;ve seen enough of these... the dialogue is very silly and ultimately forgettable. You\&#39;re just there for the giant bird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#34;science&#34; in this movie is hilarious. A monstrous otherworldly avian that can manipulate anti-matter... intent on wreaking havoc and eating people... an alien who has come to Earth to nest. Some of the best scenes in the movie (that don\&#39;t have the bird in them) include the &#34;scientists&#34; explaining what is going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot has been said about the ridiculous bird marionette. It looks like a new baby bird... bald and ugly with ruffled feathers. It even caws like a hungry, angry fledgling. However, the bird scared the crap out of my three year old, who had big scary bird nightmares for the evening. It\&#39;s a bit creepy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very sad about the scene where they shoot the egg. (Somehow the egg is not protected by an antimatter shield.) But I\&#39;m a bird lover, what can I say?&#39;
b&#39;This was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the &#34;Night Gallery&#34; show back in 1971. The episode starred Sue Lyon (of Lolita movie fame) and Joseph Campanella who play a baby sitter and a vampire, respectively. The vampire hires a baby sitter to watch his child (which appears to be some kind of werewolf or monster) while he goes out at night for blood. The baby sitter is totally oblivious to the vampire\&#39;s appearance when she first sees him and only starts to put two and two together when she notices that he has no reflection in the mirror, has an odd collection of books in the library on the occult, and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child. She realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was originally. She bolts out the door, the vampire comes out looking puzzled and the episode is over. I don\&#39;t know what purpose it was to make such an abbreviated episode that lasted just 5 minutes. They should just have expanded the earlier episode by those same 5 minutes and skipped this one. A total wasted effort.&#39;
b&#39;bad acting , combats are very awful , 3-4 second between each text , bad music , bad effect and always the same plan during the movie. if you want laugh go it 2/10 ( for the fool laugh)&#39;
b&#39;&#34;Submerged&#34; is definitely NOT &#34;the worst movie ever&#34;. It does have its flaws, such as borrowed footage, crazy script and non-existent special effects (these are the worst), but it also has some good points too. The acting is surprisingly good, there are LOTS of familiar faces whom you probably know if u\&#39;re a b-movie fan like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very glad to see Brent Huff playing one of the heroes, knowing him mostly for his 80\&#39;s action films, and i must admit, he is not a bad actor at all. Fred Williamson, Maxwell Caulfield &amp; Tim Thomerson get some limited screen time, but are believable in their parts. The &#34;eye-candies&#34; in this Fred Olen Ray movie are Yvette Nipar and Nicole Eggert, both looking very sexy and very mean. Michael Bailey Smith adds some muscle to the background as a Navy SEAL. Unfortunately the only cast member who (in my opinion) is completely out of place is Coolio. He doesn\&#39;t act at all, talks like he didn\&#39;t even read the script, and being a badass in the beginning of the movie, gets shot like a wimp a hour later. Not a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum this movie up - this is not such a bad choice for late night entertainment. If you can get over the special effects thing (so many guns, so much fire, and not a single wound on anyone), Coolio\&#39;s annoying performance, and the recycled footage from Airport 77, you might like this no-brainer after all.&#39;
b&#39;I generally won\&#39;t review movies I haven\&#39;t seen in awhile, so I\&#39;ll pop them in or rent them to give a full and fresh take on the film. In the case of \&#39;A Sound of Thunder,\&#39; I remembered my vow of never seeing this movie ever again, so I\&#39;ll just go on memory. In fact, I haven\&#39;t thought of how badly made this movie was until I read someone else\&#39;s review and remembered the experience I had back in 2005, when I actually saw this in the theater. My movie buddy forced me to see it, though I wasn\&#39;t interested, and wow. (Later on, I forced him to see \&#39;Basic Instinct 2\&#39; in the theater, reminding him he made me see this crap. So, I guess that made us even.) I certainly had my share of deep laughs (at the movie\&#39;s expense, of course,) which didn\&#39;t make him happy as he really wanted to see it. The time-travel/butterfly effect film had so many bad graphics, the loudest chuckles from me was whenever they showed the dinosaur (God, I loved seeing that dino and them actually being scared of it \xc2\x96 it was hilarious!) or just simply, Ben Kingsley. It\&#39;s great, Kingsley can remind us on how human actors can be: going from \&#39;Gandhi\&#39; and \&#39;Schindler\&#39;s List\&#39; to, uh, this. (Even a Meryl Streep can do a \&#39;She-Devil\&#39; from time to time, so they\&#39;re forgiven.) For months, I pulled an MST3k with my buddy, consistently referencing this movie to any low-rent sci-fi film or Kingsley flick. Yes, the movie would be a great movie to see drunk (or otherwise inebriated): horrible over-the-top acting, &#34;special&#34; FX that even the Nintendo64 would turn away and ridiculous plot twists. The biggest disappointment was that the Razzies didn\&#39;t even nominate this film for any award.&#39;
b&#39;Countenance! Antoine Monot, in a copycat impersonation of Kevin Smith\&#39;s Silent Bob, keeps asking for it, but writer/director Christian Z\xc3\xbcbert never listens. Z\xc3\xbcbert just can\&#39;t say no to a joke, no matter how cheap. The best thing about this movie is its soundtrack. Of course, Joey Burns of Calexico and the divine Jonathan Richman, understated old-school bard of &#34;There\&#39;s something about Mary&#34; fame, would grace any small-town dropout story. In visual allure, Stefan (Lukas Gregorowicz) looks cool enough riding his tan six-series BMW two-door, wearing aviator shades, going nowhere. True, he *accidentally* sleeps with his wild-eyed bohemian kid sister (Marie Zielcke), but then, who wouldn\&#39;t? Thumbs up also to how he goes black-and-white on a liberal dose of that mysterious substance they call zero-zero, but if you\&#39;re looking for a slightly more serious rendering of what intoxication can do to you, I suggest you check out &#34;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&#34;.&#39;
b&#39;this is the worst movie ive ever seen. And i have seen lots of movies. Me and my friends rented this one a wendsday evening. Man we had lots of fun. This movie is the worst most boring crap ive ever seen. But it makes you laugh! U will lay on the floor rolling around tryin to get some air. You wonder why? Just rent it and check for the keyboard playing girl at that sleazy russian bar. My mother would make a 1000 times better movie about her feedin the cats.&#39;
b&#34;Wow. I thought, Eskimo Limon was the most awful and embarrassing first-sex movie ever. But I had forgotten that Germany always tries to compete. In this case, the well-known German film producer Bernd Eichinger was successful in producing even worse crap. Harte Jungs is stupid, not believable and predictable, and above all: not funny. It&#39;s almost a tragedy that so many kids went to see this in Germany (and, I&#39;m afraid, also Austria).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tobias Schenke, 19, looks too nice to have no girlfriend and too ripe to be 15, and his character is too dumb to be true. Schenke tries real hard to make us believe that he doesn&#39;t know ANYthing about sex, but that doesn&#39;t help. Harte Jungs seems to be made by someone who watched Al Bundy and took him too seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best actors in the movie are Sissi Perlinger and Stefan J\xc3\xbcrgens who play Schenke&#39;s semi-liberal parents. Perlinger and J\xc3\xbcrgens are stand-up comedians who are not particularly talented in movie acting. Still, their performances are the `best&#39; and `funniest&#39; in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A complete failure.&#34;
b&#34;Ravi Chopra wrote this film 40 years back, wanted to cast Dilip Kumar in the lead&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film finally was re-written and made in 2003 and hence the subject looks dated and too superficial at times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the reason Amitabh-Hema separate is too superficial even the way the youth are shown is too bad like Gulshan in AVTAAR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The message though comes well but things are presented in a clich\xc3\xa9d manner Salman&#39;s character is the worst, looks straight out of a storybook while the climax speech of Bachchan is good and also the final of not forgiving the sons is good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ravi Chopra does a good job Music is decent, the songs sung by Bachchan stand out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amitabh excels like always, he has played an elder stern father earlier but here he plays a victim and portrays it well His last speech is great Hema is good in her part Aman Verma stands out Samir Soni is okay, Naseer and the rest sons and wives are decent though Divya Dutta stands out Salman Khan is fake, Mahima is okay Paresh and Lillete are lovable&#34;
b&#39;University Professor Justin Thorne (Jimmy Smits) has got it made. A good-looking, sophisticated teacher, with a loving wife and two adorable children. He plays the saxophone, owns an expensive car and his students love and respect him. But when temptation calls, in the form of one of his bright, pretty, sexy and willing students, Jennifer Carter (Naomi Watts), he foolishly gives in. The next day, he is being charged with her rape, and his perfect life could be forever ruined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we see an American actor in Australian film, we know we are not in for a masterpiece. But even viewed with low expectations, &#34;Gross Misconduct&#34; is a huge flop. Based on a play with a rather unimaginative title and then adapted into a reasonably enjoyable book, it fails to engage, convince or even remotely interest its audience on a most fundamental level. The script is awkward and unconvincing; the acting is, for most part, not much better. Watts gives an acceptable performance, demonstrating for one of the first times on screen her emotion rawness, but she is the only good thing about the film, which seems almost like even it can\&#39;t wait to be over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The direction is not horrible or distracting in anyway, but it is just painfully mediocre. Apart from the afore-mentioned Naomi Watts, who could be forgiven, seeing as this was early in her career, the acting is wooden and gets steadily worse over the course of the movie. The usually reliable Jimmy Smits doesn\&#39;t seem to have been trying in this one, and who could really blame him? All these small failures, however, only add to the film\&#39;s ultimate fatal flaw, which is that the focus is entirely in the wrong place. Any empathy for the characters or interest in the outcome is lost in a sea of what is basically soft-core entertainment of an adult kind. By the end, audiences will probably be bored, tired and wishing they\&#39;d done something else with their ninety minutes. Unless you just want to see Naomi get naked 4 or 5 times, you could definitely afford to give this nonevent film a miss.&#39;
b&#39;Nice movie and Nicholle Tom does a fantastic job playing the &#34;guy in the girl\&#39;s body&#34;, she really does it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sort of teen version of many other movies, but well done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well casted, from &#34;Matt&#34; to &#34;Matt2&#34;.&#39;
b&#34;After watching this movie, I couldn&#39;t help but notice the parallels between it and another film called America 3000. Both were very bad mid 1980&#39;s post apocalypse disasters on celluloid. Obviously fake sets, wooden acting and stupid monsters are found in both films. About the only difference between the two is that the lead villainess here (played by Angelika Jager) has a very thick accent. Avoid this one unless you&#39;re watching the MST3K version. Joel and the bots barely salvage this turkey.&#34;
b&#39;I\&#39;m sort of between the gushy review and the hate review. I\&#39;ve been a fan of Lovecraft (and a Lovecraft \&#39;purist\&#39;) for a long time, and while this little amateur film was of poor quality it had a number of redeeming qualities. I went into viewing expecting the worst thing I\&#39;ve ever seen, and wondering if Lovecraft would turn in his grave over it, but I was shocked to find that I actually kind of liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t want to catalog the movie\&#39;s faults, so I\&#39;ll only mention a few that keep this movie from being a \&#39;stellar amateur effort\&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s very low budget and shot on a video cam, so it has the look of some soap operas, but once you get used to the idea then it ceases to be a big deal. The direction is pretty amateur and the shot framing and use of distance in the shots is rather clumsy. STILL, this film was actually kind of creepy and it stayed more faithful to Lovecraftian intent than nearly all the Stuart Gordan and Brian Yuzna travesties (my main exception to those films being Re-Animator and Dagon) put together. The idea of being impregnated by some Old One is reminiscent of Dunwich Horror and Shadow over Innsmouth (which isn\&#39;t to say this movie is as good as those stories!!), so the overall plot is quite faithful to Lovecraft\&#39;s ideas. One thing that annoyed me was that words out of the bible seemed to make a zombie prisoner upset and afraid. I\&#39;m not sure if this was meant to indicate that \&#39;God\&#39;s\&#39; words upset the Old Ones or just this particular zombie. There was no real answer to that. The rest of the Christian symbolism in it reminds me of August Derleth\&#39;s take on the mythos. So in a way this was a Derleth style take on the mythos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this film only as a curiosity. It shows how a fairly atmospheric movie can be made with nearly zero budget. I liked the setting of the wine cellars. The outdoor shots were sad, though. Using the same stretch of beach and trees (and nearly the same damn shot) to convey 3 characters\&#39; long journey was really sad. The director needs whack upside the head for that. The acting was standard for an amateur film, with the blonde zombie girl getting a personal award for &#34;Best Impersonation of Gollum by an Italian Actress&#34;. Actually I think this film was done prior to the Lord of the Rings movies. Maybe Andy Sedaris watched her and thought &#34;Dang, she\&#39;d make a great Gollum!&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One little kudo to the director, though. The makeup on the zombies was like bad goth kids. I was upset seeing this and nearly stopped watching. I was like &#34;Oh so that\&#39;s how we know she\&#39;s evil and possessed&#34;, but later on in the movie you see a girl painting makeup like that on the face of an older woman (both living). So it wasn\&#39;t an attempt to say \&#39;goth makeup = zombie\&#39; but rather, \&#39;goth makeup was left on after zombification\&#39;. However, possessed/zombie does equal \&#39;blue contact lenses\&#39;...heh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, I still liked this movie better than the Yuzna and Gordan films (barring the aforementioned exceptions). Yuzna and Gordan had much better budgets, but this film did a better job at filming a Lovecraft-like story than they did, and on a tiny budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One quick word to the the make-up artist: I know you wanted \&#39;claws\&#39; or something on Zariah\&#39;s fingers, but long, black press-on nails looked really silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick word to the writer of the score: I know you couldn\&#39;t resist, and apparently neither could the director who okayed it, but when the two characters square off with guns for a \&#39;duel\&#39;, playing that little whistle from &#34;The Good, the bad, and the ugly&#34; killed any mood that scene had accumulated. It was cute, but cute wasn\&#39;t appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The filmmakers of this movie have read Lovecraft and had a great deal of respect for him. I enjoyed the little nods here and there: the character Carter with the bad dreams, and the character Pickman who becomes a ghoulish zombie.&#39;
b&#39;Alleged &#34;scream queen&#34; Debbie Rochon and her group of frontier prostitutes travel west to the title location and encounter grisly killings that turn out to be the work of a cult of ex-Confederate psychopaths attempting to resurrect the south through pointless massacre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Action and suspense take a backseat to loads of boring dialog and uninteresting character development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Billy Drago is good in the thankless (not to mention pointless) role of the town mortician but everything else about this wannabe slasher western is extremely poor, including the town and the fort, both of which look like modern made western tourist traps and costumes that look like they were bought at Party City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a big favor and watch Ravenous instead.&#39;
b&#34;One would think that with the incredible backdrop of WWII Stalingrad that the writers would come up with a script. Nope. There is NO story here! It&#39;s like porn, vignettes of violence interrupted by pathetic, rote, and meaningless dialogue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bunch of Germans march around shooting and getting shot. Slowly there are fewer Germans to march around, shoot, and get shot. Then there are no Germans to march around, shoot, and get shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chilcoot&#34;
b&#39;I used to think that it couldn\&#39;t get worse that &#34;Army of the Dead&#34; but this load of crap makes the afore mentioned movie look like &#34;The Godfather&#34;!! The special effects are HORRIBLE (Makes the original Nintendo graphics look like HDTV). When it comes the acting, put it this way, I went to a play with my 6 year old niece in it and she gave an Oscar worthy performance, when compared to these D-List (and that\&#39;s being kind about it) actors and actresses. So basically, if I had a gun to my head and head to chose between watching this movie again or chopping my own arm off with a dull knife, that\&#39;s a tough choice!! You know what, who needs two arms anyways??&#39;
b&#39;There are places for political commentary in film, but &#34;Masters of Horror&#34; is not one of them. I get enough of this stuff from Newsweek and every other editorial in the newspaper. Now I\&#39;ve got to watch this in horror movies? C\&#39;mon! All I wanted was a good zombie schlock film, not another &#34;Bush is bad!&#34; rant. If Joe Dante wants to express his politics, let him go on Air America. And if you must insist on making a &#34;message&#34; film, be a little more sly about it. This had all the insinuation of being slapped in the face with a dead fish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way Joe, do you really want the left-wing voting block to be associated with brain-dead zombies? Might want to think about that before making another political horror movie (God help us).&#39;
b&#34;How much do I love this film?! Now I&#39;m not a fan of bad films, but I do love a film that is so bad it&#39;s good. This is one of those. Juan Pablo Di Pace has a great butt, looks fab on screen, and definitely doesn&#39;t make a bad turn at his acting debut (I believe). Billy Zane is suitably mean and moody, though I still constantly feel that there is something more in him. I felt it in Titanic, the look on his face when La Winslet spat on him for example, totally broken, shocked, and put-down ... fierce! Kelly Brook is a pretty face ... no seriously, I think that&#39;s it! It&#39;s worth catching this to see one really hot guy, some big bra fillers from Brook, nasty growling from Billy, laugh at the dialogue, revel in the scenery and madness of the whole affair ... I&#39;m gona go watch it again now - yes, I bought it!!!&#34;
b&#34;This movie was a failure as a comedy and a film in general. It was a very slow paced movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message, but the message was a clich\xc3\xa9, hopeless mess to begin with. This movie falls on shameless environmental point, even making a self-righteous point of destroying an SUV and promoting Animal Planet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sitting through this, I couldn&#39;t help but notice that Steve Carell got no more than a single truly funny line. The only thing that could hypothetically mark this as a comedy is the pitiful attempt to give comic relief lines to Wanda Sykes. Her character gets frequent, cringe-worthy lines where they absolutely do not fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far from the brilliance of Bruce Almighty, Evan Almighty blows its whole record-breaking budget on special effect plot devices that turn out to barely advance the plot. The movie spends the first half building up to the construction of Evan&#39;s ark, but by the end, we learn that the ark was completely meaningless, and the whole plot was a just a vessel for the stupid gags and even stupider messages. The movie concludes when we learn that the whole ark, flood, and animal gathering was just a weak political statement by none other than God. Yes, God was trying to influence politics.&#34;
b&#34;This is a terrible film. Angie Dickenson is a class act and always does well, but she does not get many roles any more and she must have needed some money to do this film. By the way, she is on screen less than 10 minutes. Oooh, wait, there is one redeeming feature in this film: Meg Foster has a small part in this film. Now, Meg has been on the screen for 35 years and is not particularly great but she has the scariest eyes of any actress I have ever seen. By name, you probably don&#39;t know her, but one look at her eyes and you will recognize her. To summarize: the acting is horrid, the story bad, and even the filmography is dreadful. A screen going to black every time the director wants to change scenes is pretty moronic. Watch any thing else but this, even Mr Ed reruns!&#34;
b&#39;River Queen attempts to pack a complicated, sweeping, historical narrative into just under two hours. There are some breathtaking battle scenes and the Wanganui scenery is beautifully captured. However, the film did suffer from some poor leads - Samantha Morton (Sarah) especially came across as unconvincing. There seemed to be an indecisiveness about how the role should be played - as a helpless waif tossed by fate or as a strong, determined character with a clear view of her destiny. Kiefer Sutherland\&#39;s character - Private Doyle - seemed to be pointless and for the most part - unintelligible. Keifer\&#39;s Irish brogue needs a little polishing. On the other hand, Cliff Curtis, Temuera Morrison and Rawiri Pene (as Sarah\&#39;s son &#34;Boy&#34;) were well rounded and believable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last 20 minutes of River Queen came across as particularly compressed and rushed. It seemed as if they decided they had to tie up all the loose ends before 120 minutes were up. E.g. How on earth did Wiremu know how to find Sarah and Doyle? No explanation and very unsatisfying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did go to this movie with an open mind. I hadn\&#39;t read or heard anything much apart from its troubled production. What I experienced was a mish mash of New Zealand history, beautifully photographed but ultimately disappointing.&#39;
b&#39;According to the article at http://blog.ifeng.com/article/2737487.html, one of the actors in the film, Carina Lau, was forced to appear in this movie for free. She was the victim of an infamous kidnapping shortly before this movie was made, and later photos of her in distress were published in a magazine, which has since been forced to shut down and its publisher sent to jail. The actress denies she was assaulted but there was a movie leaked on net that allegedly showed her being gang-raped. (The Hong Kong press, out of respect for her, has mostly refused to report on the incident, but google will turn up a few articles about it.)&#39;
b&#39;&#34;Hardbodies 2&#34; is harmless, aimless and plot less. I would add &#34;brainless&#34; to that list, but the movie-within-a-movie gimmick, although not done very well, helps it to narrowly escape that label. The scenery has changed from the California beaches to the Greek islands, and the only returning cast members from the first film are Sorrells Pickard (the bearded guy) and Roberta Collins (who at one point falls into a mud pit, bringing back memories of her classic catfight with Pam Grier in &#34;The Big Doll House&#34;). All the other actors are new, but apparently Brad Zutaut is supposed to be playing the same character (Scotty) as Grant Cramer did in &#34;Hardbodies&#34;. This sequel lacks the energy and appeal of the first movie, and doesn\&#39;t come close to matching it in the &#34;hotness&#34; department, either. Of course Brenda Bakke and Fabiana Udenio are both very pretty, but the Teal Roberts - Cindy Silver - Kristi Somers team is unbeatable. &#34;Hardbodies 2&#34; is not the worst of its kind by any means, but if you only want to see one of these movies, the original is the one to get. (*1/2)&#39;
b&#39;This is a film that really makes me cringe. In 1951, MGM and Looney Toons were making some of their very best cartoons--with amazing animation, exceptional backgrounds and great stories. Then, in the late 40s, a new style of animation began to appear (such as the &#34;Crusader Rabbit&#34; series on TV)--animation with extremely simplistic artwork in order to save money. Unfortunately, Columbia Picture\&#39;s cynical ploy worked!! Instead of the public hating the toons (as they should have), many accepted them and the Oscar people (AMPAS) actually gave this film the award for Best Animated Short--giving legitimacy for an inferior product. Unfortunately, in the dollars and sense world of Hollywood, this soon began to creep into the products of legitimate studios--resulting in rather crappy cartoons. Later, it got even worse as in addition to lousy animation and backgrounds, the stories themselves became almost unbearable for adults to watch. The cleverness and style of the classic cartoons were gone. And for this tragedy, I blame, in part, GERALD MCBOING-BOING--one of the granddaddies of cheap cartoons. The story isn\&#39;t that bad but the animation is a horror and listening to the kid saying &#34;boing-boing&#34; incessantly is a pain.&#39;
b&#34;Diane Keaton is a pathetic actress. She is so boring and phony. She is the same on and off screen. I saw her in an interview with Ellen Degeneres and she behaves exactly the same as she does in movies. Her foolish facial expressions make me want to change channels. She has been in a couple of good movies, but they would have been better had someone else been picked for the part. Steve Martin doesn&#39;t add much to the movie either. He over acts as well and also ruins an old favorite. The ridiculous part Martin Short plays only adds more idiocies to the movie. I&#39;ve tried to watch the movie twice but both times had to turn it off.&#34;
b&#39;Recycled and predictable plot. The characters are as memorable as the story line. We came in few minutes late and only saw the end of the opening scene which turned out to be a good thing since it was too intense for a 3 and a 4 year old. Overall a disappointment.&#39;
b&#34;im sure he doesnt need the money for a life saving operation or transplant. in all honesty i think this review qualifies as a better movie than &#39;bulletproof&#39;. thanks for listening.&#34;
b&#39;It amazes me that anyone would find Pauly Shore entertaining: he is basically one joke that gets stale *real* fast. He has his little &#34;California&#34; jerk vocabulary and a basic stock of lame jokes. Mainly, he is just obnoxious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I watched this movie because I was up sick and there was literally nothing else on but infomercials, otherwise I would have turned it off after 30 minutes. Anyway, the film could have been OK if Pauly could have just turned off his spiel and just played it as a comic actor instead of, well, Pauly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I\&#39;m sure Pauly fans will like it anyway - but if you are not a Pauly fan, stay away from this crock of manure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to leave this comment after seeing that another user actually gave this film a 10/10! (Maybe it was Pauly!!) Personally, I gave it a 3/10 because they didn\&#39;t have any mike-in-frame shots, didn\&#39;t drop the camera, and the supporting cast was pretty good.&#39;
b&#34;First I must confess that A Separate Peace is my favorite book. So of course, I have some bias against any attempt at adapting it for a feature film or television movie. But as I began to watch this film, I was more than willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. The original version from the early 1970s, though shot at Phillips Exeter Academy where the book&#39;s author attended school, and though it stayed as faithful as it could to the book, lacked any real depth of feeling and failed to capture the essence of the characters. The original seemed to simply go through the motions. Reading the trivia about the movie, you discover that it was cast mostly with non-actors. Thus, the original has an amateurish feel to it and it ultimately fails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new version, though I will grant that it captures the look of the period better than the original, seems to have thrown the book out all together. Scenes are rearranged, characters imposed where they don&#39;t belong, characters created that were not in the book, and no attempt was made to delve into the deeper conflicts that make the book so compelling. And the cardinal sin of all: the tree is not treated as the vital, almost central character it is in the book. This is an inexcusable oversight on the part of the film makers. How could they downplay the role of the tree? Why was it not introduced immediately? Why the Dead Poet-esque beginning? And what in God&#39;s name was up with Gene&#39;s accent? This film is, to be blunt, garbage. A Separate Peace should not be a difficult book to adapt for the stage or screen. John Knowles wrote it in a perfectly fine, linear style. The film makers should have trusted the story as it was already written; make changes, sure; embellish here and there, sure; take some mild dramatic license, sure. But destroy one of the pearls of American literature in the process? What were they thinking? In their corruption of the story line, they cut any possibility of suspense or drama. The whole movie falls flat and fails miserably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a high school or college student assigned to read this book and you are thinking of skimping and just watching the movie...don&#39;t even think about it. This film will be of no help to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, we shall have to wait even longer before a version of this story comes to the screen that truly does it justice.&#34;
b&#39;I sat down through 2 hours of pure boredom. I look here on IMDB, even though it is not high on the list, it is in the top 250. I was a little surpised. Even though, yes. I am very impressed with Robin and Matt\&#39;s acting abilities, they still didn\&#39;t save the movie. I\&#39;m not sure what I really didn\&#39;t like about the movie. Maybe it\&#39;s because I dispise math. Maybe I\&#39;m not too much for dreary talking for 2 hours. Even though I loved &#34;American Beauty&#34;, but that was it. I just want my 2 hours back. It was a big waste of my time. If I\&#39;m missing something in this movie, please E-mail me. I am curious why this is on the top 250. And don\&#39;t say &#34;Because it was a good movie&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/10&#39;
b&#39;But I still enjoyed watching her, so I gave it a 3 instead of a 1. Her expressions are priceless. Some of the other cast members (e.g., Michael McKean) are really slumming, too. The cat himself is somewhat amusing. Aside from that, the movie is all cliche, culminating in a much-too-long car chase. (It\&#39;s also at this point that the movie becomes unnecessarily crude, having been very &#34;family&#34; until then.)&#39;
b&#39;If I had to pick the most depressing movie, try to be suspenseful I\&#39;ve seen it\&#39;d be this one. I know about how good the original is supposed to be, it had better be better then this one. The movie\&#39;s so dark and depressing but it isn\&#39;t interesting to watch either-I\&#39;ve seen depressing &#34;thriler&#34; type movies that were saved because of the suspense to counteratc and balence the dark quality. Vanishing didn\&#39;t have that, This was so disturbing to watch to begin with and there was nothing positive to make this a classic type movie. I think another IMDb poster got it right in saying this genre has just seen thrillers done in a far superior way. I completely agree-I would recommend skipping this one-maybe I\&#39;ll watch the original some day but I doubt it. I give this a 2 out of 10.&#39;
b&#34;The best thing about this movie for me was that Bryan Dick played Rafe and made me -melt-. Rafe and all his gorgeousness made the movie worth sitting through, even though I itched to get up and scream. I have never seen a hotter man. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-ahem- But that&#39;s not the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title? That is indeed what it is. They took the beautiful story written by Annette Curtis Klause and threw it out. I will, in all my anal-retentive glory, point out what was missing, what has changed, and all else wrong with the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sit tight and here goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Apparently, RAFE is son of ASTRID and GABRIEL, and apparently, ULF is no longer ASTRID&#39;S child, like in the book. AND, as I recall from the book, RAFE and ASTRID were LOVERS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-ASTRID is apparently BLOND, as opposed to the notably RED HAIR described in the book. I believe the book said that she looked more like a FOX than a WOLF. And the movie also shows that ASTRID is VIVIAN&#39;S aunt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-WHERE DID AXEL GO? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-VIVIAN is 19. In the book she was 16. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-VIVIAN and AIDEN meet IN HIGH SCHOOL which they both attend in the book. VIVIAN goes to see AIDEN because of his poem &#39;Wolf Change&#39;. But, according to the movie, AIDEN beat up his dad, escaped, and now lives in Romania, and draws Graphic Novels. This made me go &#39;What the F**K.&#39; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-There is no &#39;Kelly&#39; in the movie. WHERE WAS THE KELLY IN THE MOVIE. The KELLY in the book, however, hated VIVIAN. And she also dated AIDEN after they broke up. Vivian even gets tipsy in the book and trashed her room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-GABRIEL bears a striking resemblance to a Columbian Drug Lord in the movie. And he sort of sounds like one too. His acting was very good, but his appearance threw me off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-VIVIAN had NO parents in the movie. Her father and mother and 2 other siblings died in the movie. Yet in the book, when she comes home one night, her MOTHER, ESME is sitting on the couch, after fighting with ASTRID over GABRIEL. And VIVIAN has no siblings. Only her father died in the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-AIDEN accepts VIVAN for what she is. This REALLY got me. He kills RAFE in the creepy church, confronts VIVIAN, and she saves him from the others wolves, except AIDEN shoots her, so they saunter off to find medicine, and then they try to leave the city together. WTF?! In the book, AIDEN freaks out when she turns into a wolf, and cries like a chick, throws stuff at her, and so she panics, and jumps out the window. Then he makes up a story that he tried to break up with her, and she threw a chair out of the window. That doesn&#39;t sound accepting to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-AIDEN wants her to runaway with him. In the book, he wants nothing to do with VIVAN after she turns for him. Nor does he lovingly hold her face and say she can control it. He cries like a woman because he is SCARED of her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the final indignation...the one that nearly gave my three best friends and I HEART ATTACKS IN OUR SEATS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-In the movie, AIDEN and VIVIAN run away together, and VIVAN has killed GABRIEL. As in she SHOOTS him. GABRIEL dies. In the *BOOK* not only does VIVIAN not kill GABRIEL, I do believe they END UP TOGETHER. As in, she doesn&#39;t end up with AIDEN, she ends up with GABRIEL. WHAT THE HELL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small things were noticed too: Ulf&#39;s red hair which he gets from Astrid has been changed to brown in the movie, and Vivian works at a chocolate shop. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A horrible shock; I am ashamed. The book really wasn&#39;t hard to follow. If Disney can use a random H!School, why couldn&#39;t the directer have found a random H!School? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*sigh* I was really looking forward to this movie, I loved the book, it&#39;s sad that it didn&#39;t follow it one bit. I give it a 2, only because (as the top of this review states) Rafe (played by Bryan Dick) was dead sexy, and Agnes Bruckner did a wonderful job. AND, they kept the poem from Steppenwolf &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With love,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caitlin&#34;
b&#39;The only reason to see this film is Sung Hi Lee, the stunning model/actress from Korea who plays &#34;Muka Laka Miki&#34; (give me a break) in this otherwise crappy movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is given a fairly substantial part in this film and seems to handle it well, though none of the parts is really interesting or well written. Even for a National Lampoon\&#39;s movie, it\&#39;s really stupid. Stupid humor is one thing, but just stupid is another. I may have laughed once, and that was probably just me being polite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Watching this movie may be bad for your health on two counts: 1) It, like, totally sucks. 2) Sung Hi Lee is so freaking gorgeous she just might blow your brains out of the back of your head upon first sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So don\&#39;t say I didn\&#39;t warn you...&#39;
b&#34;Finally, I can connect the dots between Return of the Jedi and Phantom Menace. We see here where Lucas lost touch with what made the original Star Wars films great and began to descend into the plot less tripe that ruined episodes 1-3. This film is more like one of those cheesy low-budget 80s swords and sorcerer films than anything worthy of being associated with the Star Wars saga. As with the Jar-Jar character, this seems targeted at children (and the toy market). The battle scenes are particularly bad. It was depressing to see Sian Phillips&#39; incredible talent go to such a waste, after her classic performance in I, Claudius.&#34;
b&#34;Avida is a game of words mingling life and eagerness, but I personally think this movie was overblown by its ambition and does not make justice to its title. It gathers a set of awkward characters united by unbelievable links. Furthermore, the way everything is connected at the end is, in my opinion, a bit pathetic. What remains of it was a set of images... an interesting one, but not enough to make this a good movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this film is supposed to be a comedy, but I surely didn&#39;t noticed! The nonsense and caricatural nature of the movie is actually the only good thing about it, but when it drags on an on and on it becomes no longer bearable. I have to say I fought hard to continue seeing it until the end, and I am still not sure it was worth it...&#34;
b&#34;I was browsing through the movies on demand and saw Underdog for free and it was only 82 minutes long so I decided to watch it. I wasn&#39;t expecting much but it exceeded my expectations of being awful. Everything about the movie was cringe worthy. The dialogue was atrocious including many terrible puns. The jokes were also terrible. I found myself yelling and flipping off my television screen while I was suffering through this trash. It hit its target audience very well but I don&#39;t see how anyone else could enjoy this film. It made me very angry and nearly cry because of everything terrible this film had going for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only enjoyable thing about this movie was being able to give it a 1/10 after viewing it. I beg you to avoid it at all costs. I understand the fact that its made for kids but there is nothing likable about it at all.&#34;
b&#34;I just have watched Icon on DVD and despite being a great book, the movie is a weak substrate from it. Those responsible for the writing should be banished to Siberia. Why they maul the great story with all kind of C-film subploys which are totally irrelevant to the story is totally beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet the filmmakers and cast do there best to make something out of it, but at the end the film was not satisfying at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can someone please make a decent movie out of this to show how it is done. I&#39;m sure that the crowds will rally for such a masterpiece novel turned into a book, not into a cheap C-movie.&#34;
b&#34;Another bad spanish picture. This is very baaaad. I only save the photography and the music of Jos\xc3\xa9 Nieto. The rest of the film is the worst I&#39;ve seen in years. Paz Vega is horrible. Don&#39;t see it.&#34;
b&#34;I can&#39;t really remember any details of this movie except that the setting looked awfully familiar. Then I realized it was filmed at the Lazy Lizard Hostel in Moab, Utah. That was one of my favorite places to visit when I was younger and wandered around the country. The guy who owns/manages the hostel managed to get himself in the movie. All I remember about the plot of the movie is that it involves jeeps and naked women. It is great to watch just for the scenery (I mean the rock formations)... If you are just looking for soft-core porn, you will probably be better served elsewhere. I don&#39;t even know if this movie is available on tape or DVD.&#34;
b&#34;For many years Ed Wood&#39;s Classic &#39;Plan 9&#39; has been considered the worst film ever made. Forget it The Roller Blade Seven is infinitely worse. The cast is made up of famous peoples brothers and almost famous or has been actors and actresses. The plot along with the budget and script are non-existent. The running time is made up not in the classic Ed Wood style of using stock footage. Instead there is endless slow motion and repeated action. And as for The Roller Blade Seven aren&#39;t even seven of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must see this film just to know how bad film making can really be. Giving independent film makers everywhere hope.&#34;
b&#34;The movie is not that bad, Ringo Lam sucks. I hate when Van Damme has love in his movies, van Damme is good only when he doesn&#39;t have love in his movies.&#34;
b&#39;A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away (sound familiar), water has become the most precious commodity (this has got to sound familiar) and a small minority control its distribution (what a surprise, just have a heart attack and die from that surprise). A group of ice pirates (water renegades?\xc2\x85wet bandits?...oh wait, that last one\&#39;s been used) try to discover the route to a fabled unlimited supply of water with a lovely but spoiled (Druish?) princess en tow and a group of idiots\xc2\x85er\xc2\x85despicable villains in pursuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie has the potential to be a really great comedic parody (&#34;Star Wars,&#34; David Lynch\&#39;s &#34;Dune&#34;) but was just not handled correctly. It goes for, I believe the term is, &#34;low brow&#34; humor. It doesn\&#39;t really succeed in being all that funny which is a shame since it has Angelica Houston, Ron Perlman and Robert Urich, (hence the three stars) who aren\&#39;t exactly slackers in the acting department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a rental and definitely have a drink straight up.&#39;
b&#34;The only people i would recommend this film to are both blind and deaf, although i&#39;m sure a sadomasochist would get a kick out of it. This film had nothing; no acting, terrible music, awful script- only the power to suck any happiness from your soul. You may be wondering by now why or even how i managed to sit through the full hour and a half of sheer inanity, and it is honestly a difficult concept for even myself. Firstly, i had to pace up and down as the film progressed as i found it extremely hard to get comfortable. Secondly, i only made it without gnawing off my own arm in order to have something to beat myself to death with by phoning friends for moral support when the plot became particularly slow. The problem was it became a matter of pride for me to finish it after the opening thirty minutes, and that was a fatal error on my behalf. I normally like films to leave you with something by the end, but all this did was take..... For the sake of your sanity do not watch this film.&#34;
b&#39;CUJO is a movie adaptation of a novel of the same name written by Stephen King.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;ve never read the novel but just scanning the comments page has given me some insight. I noticed a reference to the change in the ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot of the movie is as follows - a St. Bernard dog gets bitten by a rabid bat and goes on a killing spree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot sounds quite worn now, having been done in various movies. However it might have been something new when King wrote the novel. Or perhaps King\&#39;s novel put a twist on the story that was never shown in the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the first 40 minutes of this movie have nothing at all worth mentioning other than the dog being bitten. Nothing else happens - nothing scary, nothing funny, nothing to add depth to the characters and nothing interesting in any other respect. I found this section difficult to sit through and was constantly shouting at the TV, &#34;come on, get started!&#34;. The events that I was seeing on the screen were reminiscent of a TV movie of the drama genre or an extended episode of a TV soap opera. Unfortunately, there was only one family in the movie given any focus so it couldn\&#39;t even work on a soap opera level. The dog was the best character in the movie, but it didn\&#39;t get enough screen time in this section. There was nothing to indicate why this dog would go on a killing spree later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the 40 minute mark point, something finally happened. The dog suddenly transformed from a lovable pet into a vicious killing machine. It began attacking some people. There was also an interesting cat-and-mouse chase when two characters became trapped in a car, unable to leave because the dog would attack them. Even in this overly long second half, the suspense would build up well before dying again. It was just a stop-go situation repeated over and over again until the movie reached its conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without giving the ending away, I can tell you it was very formulaic and unworthy of a Stephen King story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suspense scenes when they are on the screen are exciting to watch. Some great camera angles add menace to the dog\&#39;s vicious nature when he attacks people. This is particularly important because as others have mentioned a St. Bernard dog is nowhere near as scary as, say, a Rottweiler. Unfortunately, the movie fails to utilise suspenseful music to support the images on the screen. The music is far too melodramatic rather than suspenseful. This may fit a TV movie but it looks incredibly out of place in what should be a dark-toned movie presenting a living nightmare to the viewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brings me on to a wider problem with this movie - the photography. The camera-work and especially the choice of colours make this seem like a very cheap TV movie one would expect to see as the daytime movie on Channel 5 here in the UK where I am writing this comment from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top two actors deliver good acting performances that help to breathe life into the movie\&#39;s dull segments. Dee Wallace and Danny Pintauro should be given credit for doing a great job with the poor material they are given. I could forgive a few brief moments of overacting by paying closer attention to the dialogue, which could not have allowed any other interpretation in my opinion. I won\&#39;t pass judgement on the other actors because they are given virtually nothing to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who is a fan of SALEM\&#39;S LOT and STEPHEN KING\&#39;S IT, both movie adaptations of famous Stephen King novels, I had high expectations for this movie. But it turned out to be a massive disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do not recommend fans of Stephen King or horror movies in general to watch CUJO. This is one of those moments where I have to recommend the book rather than the movie. Hopefully it brings the story to life in a way that the movie failed to do.&#39;
b&#34;This story starts at the end ! So the film&#39;s opening credits advise us. Unfortunately that&#39;s not true as we then are treated to around 70 minutes of a typical B science fiction movie of the 1950&#39;s. The story is dreary; the plot is very weak and has clearly been filmed on a low budget, as was often the case in those days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story could have covered any situation where people are taking refuge in an isolated house and being threatened by someone outside. it just happened to be adapted to fit round a sci-fi story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scenery consisted of a few rocks, bushes, and smoke. - Oh yes there was a pool of water as well. Someone wore a rubber mask with a beak like face and what looked like feathers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written by Lou Rusoff, who penned several sci-fi stories around that time including The She Creature and It Conquered The World The filming was completed in a matter of days, not allowing the actors time to develop their characters to better advantage. The low budget restraints also prevented this film reaching its potential. It could have been a much better film than it turned out to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike Connors and Richard Denning brought some life to the film, but even they could not lift this film into the category where you could say- &#39;I enjoyed that film&#39; Richard Denning&#39;s acting career began in 1937. He starred with Gregory Peck and Deborah Kerr in An Affair to Remember and later became more well known on television in the series Hawaii Five-O and The Flying Doctor series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directed by Roger Corman who has many films to his credit both as a director and producer. He has made some good films and is still making them. He became very well known for his direction of films from the stories of Edgar Allan Poe, often starring Vincent Price. He also made other low budget films; some were good and entertaining for one reason or another, and most were much better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this film to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darnmay &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10th September 2007&#34;
b&#34;Due to rather dubious plate tectonics, Japan starts to slip under the sea. Initial predictions say it&#39;ll take about 40 years before the country is submerged, but a rogue scientist adds in some even more dubious science and determines it will actually take less than 1 year! The government think he&#39;s a crackpot, but evidence soon starts bearing his theory out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This big budget disaster movie follows the formula set by any number of Hollywood films of the late 90&#39;s (I assume, having seen none of them), with the scale of disaster and tragedy bringing out the nobility of the human (well, Japanese) spirit in acts of heroism and sacrifice, and proving the power of love or something like that. i.e. it&#39;s as naive in its psychology as it&#39;s geology... we all know that half the populace would be out raping and looting the minute they thought the police had their back turned, and the other half would just panic and be useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film does have some very nice special effects, but is not as slick or expensive looking as an equivalent Hollywood production would be. It is at least as nationalistic, humourless and lacking in self-awareness as that Hollywood film would be though, and probably has even worse acting. It does have the hot evil chick from Battle Royale as one of the leads... but she&#39;s not even slightly evil, and is therefore much less hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is much too long at 132 minutes, and gets worse and worse as it progresses towards a conclusion that had me in danger of puking. I certainly didn&#39;t care in the slightest whether Japan sank or not by the half way point, and well before the end I was trying to think of ways to expedite the process should I ever find myself in that situation for real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it does have nice special effects, and Kou Shibasaki is still pretty hot, so I magnanimously give it... 3/10.&#34;
b&#34;I was struck by the awful acting and script for this movie. All the characters seem rendered immobile by personal issues - rather like deer in headlights. They dither around whining and moaning about their emotions when decisive actions need to be taken. I found myself yelling at the TV screen trying to wake them up to their situation and DO SOMETHING! The plot line is implausible. Every time there is a key decision to be taken by a lead character, one of the other characters has to bring up all the problems with the obvious decision as though to further render the decision more difficult - it is a tried melodramatic ploy and just wants to make you groan. Clearly the import of the decision is obvious - you don&#39;t need to treat the audience as idiots. Overall - there is just too much emotional melodrama in the whole movie.&#34;
b&#34;With a cheap pound shop having just opened,i thought that it was worth looking to see if their were any cheap DVDs that looked good.and while the back of the cover made this sound like a Jeepers Creepers type of film,it is actually an anthology film! and thought one or two of the stories feel very familiar.Its still a fun light horror/comedy. The plots:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Story one:The classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A young couple feel the it is time that they should try to in prove their financial life by picking up a $1500 car.But,when the guy goes to pick a car,a car starts to talk to him.The car (called Banns) says that to get everything that he has ever wanted in life,that he must buy Baans for $5000.So while the guys relationship crumbles,Baans does everything he can to show who really is in charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Story two:Kitchen culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A guy that might get thrown out by his land lord,due to how messy his flat is,discovers that due to keeping a tuna pasta in his fridge for six months,the it has now moulded and evolved into a green mouldy version of himself!.And while they start off as friends,they end up having a big falling out,the leads to a final battle to see if the real guy or his fridge clone will survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Story three:Too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A girl signs up with a dating agency and she gets matched with a guy the is perfect for her.But she is unsure that the guy is too perfect,and when she thinks that she sees him &#39;shut down&#39; she starts to get spooked. View on the film:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that i have to mention is the rating for the film in england,where it has been given an eighteen rating,even thought it has no nudity,swearing or blood at all.And the other odd thing about all the stories is that they all have happy endings,where the goodies win!.And while the first story is too close to the Stephen King classic Christine,the second story is easily the highlight of the film,with director Tom Parkinson making the nuttiness of the story feel like a low-budget Muppets episode!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final view on the film&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it does have a bit of a &#39;remake; feel,their is enough wackiness to make this a good horror &#39;comedy&#39;.&#34;
b&#39;This movie is just downright horrible, the movie was only an hour long and for about 25mins of the movie was just useless random snowboarding clips that don\&#39;t even connect to the movie. The storyline is completely &#34;retarted&#34;, my 5 year old cousin could probably write a better script. I don\&#39;t understand how someone could fund the production of a film like this ... horrible. This is definitely the shittiest most horrid movie i\&#39;ve ever seen in my entire existence. I think the casting director just took some random kids from off the street to act in this movie. The directing, acting, producing and writing for this film are all really bad. I feel bad for the people who wasted money funding this garbage. U couldn\&#39;t pay me to watch this crap again.&#39;
b&#34;I took my 14 year old to see this movie. We left after 15 or 20 minutes. It was absolutely awful! This movie should be rated R at the least. I am not that strict with movies but, this was just too much. It was a waste of money. I thought it would contain some comedy and I knew the comedy would probably be crude but, this was WAY beyond crude. I was sitting there watching and reading (a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really got me) and I could not believe how crudely sexual it was. I could not believe that it would be OK for a 13 year old to read and see this content. I don&#39;t understand how the rating system works.??&#34;
b&#34;Ah, such an original title for a very shoddy film. The dubbing is hilarious since the voices and mouths never seem to match. As a result, I had no idea what was going on as I watched this mess unfold. There are flashbacks within the flashbacks and no real time takes place until towards the very end. The Aztec ceremony had me laughing. I rewinded it twice and got the best ab workout ever. The singing Aztec lady is comic naturale and the dancing and costumes are a hoot. Some guy gets a face full of acid, there&#39;s a lot of fighting, you have no idea who any character is (not that I really cared), and it&#39;s a whole noir mess. Oh, and the actual fight doesn&#39;t happen for awhile, so during the movie feel free to get up, take a nap, take a trip. You won&#39;t miss anything exciting.&#34;
b&#34;First of all, let me say that I am in no way denying the importance of the subject - quite the opposite. I am Polish and I have been aware of the Katyn massacre for quite a long time (in fact, two of my family members died there), so I was looking forward to this film. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the main problem lies with the script, which encompasses too many subplots and characters, none of which are properly developed. The characters are painfully one-dimensional; their stories are intertwined, but lack overall meaning. In my opinion the cast doesn&#39;t really have a chance to show their ability. The exception is Andrzej Chyra, portraying Jerzy - the only interesting character. I wish the story was more focused on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, the film lacks emotion. Before seeing it I thought I would be moved, if only for sentimental reasons - but in fact I was watching it with an odd sense of detachment throughout, except for the final execution scene. It is done well and its placing is interesting and provides a climactic ending, although the idea of the Lord&#39;s Prayer being recited in unison by the executed officers seems a bit far-fetched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To conclude, I suppose the film may have some educational value for those who are not familiar with the portrayed historical events, but in my opinion it fails as a work of cinema.&#34;
b&#39;This is one heck of a sleazy film. Like so many &#34;women in chains&#34; films, this one is chock full of lesbianism. However, unlike most prior films, which strongly implied this, BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA shows an awful lot of skin as a horny female prison guard leers at the women as they shower as well as has sex with one of the inmates. For the early 1970s, this is definitely a soft-core pornographic film--sort of like GIRLS GONE WILD GOES TO PRISON! It\&#39;s also a bad rip-off of THE DEFIANT ONES, though in this case it\&#39;s two hot females who hate each other who are chained together when they escape. Whereas the original film is considered a classic, this one can only be considered a classic example of bad taste. That\&#39;s because there is no subtlety and the movie is just cheap--cheap thrills, cheap writing and very cheap acting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam Grier is the &#34;black inmate with an attitude&#34;--a lady who was set up and sent to prison on this hellish island. Margaret Markov is a revolutionary. When they escape, they both can\&#39;t stand each other and have opposite goals. However, since it is clich\xc3\xa9-driven, there\&#39;s really no surprise in how the film ends--with their both becoming (gag me) friends.&#39;
b&#34;I managed to avoid reading Hemingway in college. From what I could tell, along with his reductivist verbiage, he offered reductivist story lines. This film-transfiguration of AF2A into a simplistic, hoary, belabored narrative, does not disabuse me of my suspicions: A guy who barely sees action on the European battlefield (Hudson) falls in with a nurse (Jones), and they conspire to spend time together. Hemingway&#39;s big contribution to narrative was the romantic travelogue? Who knows what these two lovers have in common? They&#39;re so utterly generic. The movie never even brings up the utter irresponsibility it takes to abandon the front in favor of a lovers&#39; adventure. The two have a season on the Alps, straight out of a J. Crew catalog. A number of better scenes are undermined by corny, conventional melodrama elsewhere. The movie keeps piling on tiny, improbable, unspecific details that fight the epic treatment. The cavernous hospital that Miss Barkley works in is virtually empty, so that no secondary plot line can possibly distract from the flimsy main story. Complicated, it is not. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The camera work is better than average, with some amazing location photography. Director Charles Vidor (or maybe Huston?) does striking things in the first hour with an on-location, wide-screen camera... there are no second unit cop-outs. Vidor shows massive, panoramic tableaux, pans over a line of hundreds of soldiers trooping through the mountains; and then with a 90 degree swivel of his camera catches up with Hudson&#39;s ambulance barreling down on him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hudson looks great. He&#39;s a better actor than he gets credit for, but with unshaped material like this, he can become very mechanical. Mercedes McCambridge plays a one-dimensional shrew. Jennifer Jones is puffy and miscast in the lackluster female lead. The movie is best when she&#39;s off screen. The love scenes are about as affecting as a coffee commercial.&#34;
b&#34;This movie is a terrible attempt at a spoof. Its attempts to parody various sports movies are half-baked and not at all funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even things that should be funny - like the female kicker from India who&#39;s always wearing traditional dress over her uniform - aren&#39;t really funny. The fact that the football team studies and gets good grades which makes the coach mad didn&#39;t get any laughs either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot of having a traditional loser get one more chance by coaching a loser high school football team really had potential as a spoof. It&#39;s a classic and trite sports theme. But alas, the screenplay was too weak for ANY cast to pull it off. And this cast is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is gratuitous use of women in bikinis and underwear, so it&#39;s not all bad from that aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Animal House or Talladega Nights, this is not.&#34;
b&#34;Interesting and short television movie describes some of the machinations surrounding Jay Leno&#39;s replacing Carson as host of the Tonight Show. Film is currently very topical given the public drama surrounding Conan O&#39;Brien and Jay Leno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film does a good job of sparking viewers&#39; interest in the events and showing some of the concerns of the stakeholders, particularly of the NBC executives. The portrayal of Ovitz was particularly compelling and interesting, I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, many of the characters were only very briefly limned or touched upon, and some of the acting seemed perfunctory. Nevertheless, an interesting story.&#34;
b&#39;If I was British, I would be embarrassed by this portrayal of incompetence. A protection agent of the Special Branch unable to defend herself against a sick, unarmed and untrained assailant? The Home Office sends a single &#34;Science Adviser&#34; to investigate a possible Level Four biohazard, and that &#34;Advisor&#34; doesn\&#39;t have the sense to wear even a mask and gloves? Totally unprotected London police officers working side by side with technicians in full biohazard suits? The &#34;Advisor&#34; and his bodyguard bearding the lair of a sociopathic doctor experimenting on human subjects without any backup? Puh-leeze! One wonders whether the producers could not afford to hire any technical advisers or if, for some arcane reason, they consciously decided to portray the principals as hopelessly incompetent. Even my wife, who has no background in either medicine or law enforcement, was rolling her eyes in disbelief. After the first episode, I was discouraged; now that I have seen two episodes, I give up.&#39;
b&#34;I&#39;m sorry to say this but I didn&#39;t enjoy this movie at all. It was just too boring. So boring that I couldn&#39;t watch the rest of it. It&#39;s not as interesting as the Lion King or Aladdin. That&#39;s why I hate this stupid days because these days are just not what they used to be. The movies that Disney have released lately really sucks! I miss the old days when they used to produce good movies like the Lion King, Aladdin, Pocahontas, Cinderella, The Aristocats, and Robin Hood. This movie is really awful. I really tried my best to be interested in this movie but I just couldn&#39;t. I don&#39;t think I could recommend this film to anyone. I would recommend the ones that I just mention above.&#34;
b&#39;Disappointing film with Walter Pidgeon as a hunter who goes to Germany to assassinate Hitler. When he is discovered, he is coerced into signing a document stating that he acted on orders from England. His refusal to sign the document brings us to the plot of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pidgeon is pursued back to England by the evil George Sanders and his cohort, John Carradine, who speaks little, but is again as always, the embodiment of wickedness personified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along the way of being pursued, Pidgeon meets up with Joan Bennett, the latter displaying a wonderful cockney accent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story gets bogged down somewhat as love develops between the two, but again as we approach World War 11, realism becomes the object of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The near-ending scene in the cave between Sanders and Pidgeon is nicely realized but we know where that arrow is going to go to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very interesting that while Pidgeon is fleeing Nazi Germany, he meets up again with a young Roddy McDowall, one of Pidgeon\&#39;s many co-stars that same year in the memorable &#34;How Green Was My Valley.&#34; How green was &#34;Man Hunt?&#34;&#39;
b&#34;In a sense, this movie did not even compare to the novel. However, it was good to have a visual of what the Congo looked like and also the natives if you are not good at visualizing as you read. I would never recommend watching the movie rather than reading the book. I hardly suggest even watching this film, let alone any other films based on this literary work. This movie; and many others, did not fulfill this book. One important part that is missing from the movie is MArlow&#39;s sense of how government of lack of there in Africa was forming an early genocide. Also in the movie, MArlow and his companions didn&#39;t stop and get the note and wood. Likewise, Kurtz&#39; African mistress knocks Marlow out towards the end of the story which has a major influence in the story but was not in the book. In the novel, Kurtz died on the ship, however he died in his hut in the movie. The fianc\xc3\xa9&#39;s reaction to Marlow&#39;s interpretation of Kurtz&#39; last words also differed. This movie is only effective if you wish to visualize more clearly the novel.&#34;
b&#39;I think this is one of those few movies that I want to rate it as low as possible just to pay it a compliment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven\&#39;t seen this movie in about 25 years, so I really can\&#39;t say that much about it. It still seems to be very hard to find on video. But I remember my brother and I stumbled upon it somewhere in the toxic brew of late night UHF channel television of the mid 1980s when I was about 10 years old. So I\&#39;ve never actually seen the beginning of the movie, but I saw most of it. The first thing I remember is this couple is sneaking out of a campsite and they\&#39;re rowing to an island to make out, and then they get attacked by an insane Scotsman in a kilt with an axe! They manage to escape from him but get attacked by the Loch Ness Monster, which in this movie is just a head and a neck with no body. The eyes and the mouth of the monster don\&#39;t even move, it looks like a pi\xc3\xb1ata.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean I had just literally never seen anything on this magnitude before and it totally blew my mind. I had seen some bad movies on TV in the early 80s but I had never seen something so totally inept and so casually and thoughtlessly constructed that it seemed like the people who made it spent less time and effort on it than we did watching it. I had already seen some of the Troma films and that type of thing that tries to deliberately be &#34;campy&#34;, but this was the pure and real stuff and it was my first encounter with truly great bad film-making. This movie was like the last gasp of the drive-in era and I caught a whiff of it just in time. Actually when we were watching it, we couldn\&#39;t figure out if it was made in the 50s or the 70s. Turns out it came out just a few years before I saw it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later I came into contact with Mystery Science Theater and found out about a lot of the old B movies and serials, but I had already seen it in this movie. The movie is so funny that I had never even laughed that hard at the Monty Python crew or Bill Murray or any comedian. After seeing this movie I was always trying to search for the &#34;good bad&#34; movies and I got a lot of my friends into it. But this movie was and basically is an impossible one to find. I never really found out what it even was or who Larry Buchanan was until the 1990s when IMDb took off and the internet took off and information started getting passed around. But this movie still needs to be discovered by a lot of others who might appreciate its transcendentally bad qualities. Look for it.&#39;
b&#34;There have been many movies, on living the American dream. And this is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, on the technical side, there is a lot wrong. The audio is bad, i had trouble understanding the dialogs here and there, and the camera positions could have been better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They really tried to come up with a good movie, but for example the part where they show, how Jonathan is loosing himself in the dream,with girls, drugs and alcohol, is done very badly. The acting is very poor as well from all the characters in the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a hard time watching it from the beginning till end, and couldn&#39;t wait for the movie to be over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your expectations are low, and you&#39;re bored on a Sunday with bad weather, watch it. If you in for a deep story with action, then this is not your movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally i would not have give a score of 1, but of 4.5 for this movie. But the reason i gave it a 1 is because of the bad audio, and camera uses, not to mention the bad cut scenes with cheesy effects.&#34;
b&#34;I really wanted to like this movie. A film with zombie children getting out of a mine to kill people at night really seemed like a great idea for a horror film. Unfortunately, the film was in the bottom 3 of films played at horror fest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A mother and her two daughters attempt to move on after her husband/father had passed away from an illness that cost their family a lot of money. They have to adapt to their new environment. They end up struggling due to all the surroundings for different reasons.(Crazy Zombie kids go into this category) The film never gives any sentimental attachment for anyone that lives or dies, the film produces no scares or jump worthy moments, the film barely shows the children doing what they&#39;re supposed to do...Kill! With a bigger budget and a better cast this film could have hope. Until then, pass on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.5/10 actually.&#34;
b&#34;What offends me most about the critics following this film is the mentioning of &#39;originality&#39;. This film does not contain ONE innovating element. If, by &#39;originality&#39; you refer to pathetic action scenes, overacting, gluttony in violence, blunt humor and a script beyond intellectual belief. Then, &#39;originality&#39; is something Swedish film can do without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How R\xc3\xb6se and Karlsson can agree to &#39;act&#39; in this poor excuse for a film is a mystery to me. And how Eva R\xc3\xb6se after the making of this film can be seen at breakfast-TV promoting it just disappoints me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film doesn&#39;t contain a story, the script is illogical, stiff and last but not least, just plain bad. These two young directors have put together a quite disgusting boy-fantasy containing violence, comic-strips and trivialized psychological portraits. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the scene of DD masturbating in the kitchen over a micro-wave dinner actually is put there to describe the everyday life of these two overgrown cinematic nerds that pose as directors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#39;t show this movie to my worst enemy.&#34;
b&#34;A few of my fellow writers have covered this movie&#39;s plot elements so I will stick to some of the cuff remarks...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This is entertaining - but not for the reasons you&#39;d think. It&#39;s cheesy but somehow still watchable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Tamra, Daniel&#39;s love interest has to be about thirty. The Christian girl that Dan ignores is way cuter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Muriel stole his shirt from Mr. Spock. Also, if my guardian angel looks like Muriel I&#39;m going to have to apply for a transfer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Okay... so apparently... Dan is responsible for his parents&#39; divorce! What kind of horrible guilt trip is that?! Muriel says that it was Dan&#39;s prayers that kept his parents together. I just thought that was absolutely ridiculous. Listen, I can pray for my parents as much as I want but the only way they&#39;ll stay together is if they decide they&#39;re going to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. I&#39;ll echo the atheist&#39;s comments on how this movie portrays non-Christians. Apparently they&#39;re all slovenly bullies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. For something positive - David White is a decent actor. He gives the movie a little bit of credibility, even if he is the only one. He pretty much holds this film together on his own.&#34;
b&#39;Stealing is a crime, and these guys, Kenny Yakkel and Corbin Bernsen look like their going to get away with it. I haven\&#39;t even seen this film, but not only do i know it sucks, but the fact that it steals the story of another film, or 2 films for that matter, is such bull crap (and if IMDb would allow profanity much more than just bull crap) that I become filled with rage and feel as though I should just throw myself out the window and just end it all. O.k that\&#39;s a little much but stealing is worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever seen Pontypool? It was this awesome little zombie film made in 2008, this radio host goes into work, and then this zombie attack happens. We only see what\&#39;s going on inside the radio station, and the only guess we have on what\&#39;s happening on the outside are the occasional calls from their eye in the sky Ken Loney (easily the funniest moment in the film in my mind) and the BBC calling in for an update on the situation. From all the reviews I\&#39;ve read, and from the conversation I had with my friend (who has seen this film and Pontypool) this film was exactly like it in the story, with minor tweaks here and there. So throw originality and creativity out the window. As for the Zombies, or the infected, whatever you want to call them. They are the exact same thing, just because they got infected does not change the fact that they walk around mindlessly, and have a never ending quench for flesh. They are Zombies. ZOMBIES!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ZOMBIES!!! Okay one to many, but back to this crappy movie. The Zombies from what I\&#39;ve heard are a lot like the ones in 28 Days Later, another better movie, with their insane rage and even more insane quench of flesh. This is where Zombie movies define themselves, story does not matter in a zombie movie (as long as your not taking the idea of another film). Sure a zombie movie can be enhanced by the story, as is the case with Pontypool, but the zombies have to be, in a way, original. 28 Days Later started the insane raging Zombie. Pontypool I can\&#39;t even begin to explain those guys without ruining the film. The Evil Dead, I think all i have to do is just type the name again because, come on it\&#39;s The Evil Dead. Romero is the master, and he went through all different types of zombies, from the painted face zombies in Dawn of the Dead to raging zombies in Diary of the Dead, and he did each one with his own unique style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after talking about other great zombie movies, I think it\&#39;s about time I explain why I hate this movie without even seeing it. This movie down right steals the original story outline to Pontypool which i think is called plagiarism and is illegal in this country and many people get kicked out of school for doing this very thing, yet in Hollywood it\&#39;s allowed, and apparently approved of. This is not the only film that takes the outline of another movie, and just tries to tell it differently. The 90\&#39;s is like the worst period for movies ever, sure it had some gems but what decade doesn\&#39;t, and it\&#39;s because all the movies were the exact same. My favorite, the crime movie with a twist so big that you\&#39;ll never guess it till the very end. They force feed you one suspect, make it seem impossible that it\&#39;s not anybody else but him, then, bam, all this time it was this guy, you just had to look at the scenes where he wasn\&#39;t there and then when he would mysteriously show up out of the blue, say &#34;hey guys, what did i miss?&#34; OH! DIDN\&#39;T SEE THAT COMING DID YA! Well, I\&#39;ll leave a clich\xc3\xa9 as my closing statement. This is one film you\&#39;ll surely want to miss.&#39;
b&#39;This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly. The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film. A truly, truly bad film.&#39;
b&#39;THE GOOD: The acting were great especially Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton. Terrence Howard should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor instead of Matt Dillon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD: I\&#39;m a visible minority (non-white) and I have experienced some form of racism in my life. BUT despite my life experiences and the movie\&#39;s subject matter, I would definitely NOT say that this movie is the best of the year, in fact, it\&#39;s FAR from it. I have problems with this movie both from a moviegoer\&#39;s perspective and from a visible minority\&#39;s perspective. Some of my problems with this movie are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) Poor character development (or none at all). Just because we saw extremes in a character, for example, Matt Dillon being a racist cop and being a good caregiver to his ailing father, that does not mean in any way that the character is well-developed. Yes, I admit that in a big cast ensemble like in this movie, it is quite difficult for every character to be well-developed, BUT that does not mean that at none of the characters should be like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) The dialogue seems really contrived to the point that I\&#39;m really surprised this movie won for Best Original Screenplay. They should show this movie in a screenplay writing class NOT because it\&#39;s good but to show students and future screenplay writers what NOT to do. I just felt like I\&#39;ve been hit by the head over and over again how bad racism is. I get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) The plot seems so coincidental, it is laughable. What are the chances of a black car robber running over an Asian guy who also happens to be a human trafficker while entering his van, and that same black car robber ended up carjacking that Asian guy\&#39;s van several hours later after he brought him the hospital, only to find out that the several Asians being trafficked inside the van just to show you that the black car robber has a good side after all? Or, what about that scene where a prejudiced upper-class white woman who fell down the stairs and all her prejudice and hatred vanished into thin air? If it was THAT simple, why don\&#39;t we throw every racist in America down the stairs so they will have a change of heart?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) I think my biggest misgivings about this movie is the unrealistic view of racism. As someone who has experienced racism in my life, the realistic view of racism is that it is hidden rather than in your face. I\&#39;ve been refused to enter a supermarket because I\&#39;m not white. Did the store owner said because I was not white? No, he said the store was closing even though there were a lot of people shopping inside. Did he yell racial slurs? No. Racism in America is more hidden. Some cab drivers probably won\&#39;t stop to pick you up because you\&#39;re non-white but that does not mean that they will try to run you over or get out and say racial slurs. If a Chinese woman rear-ended me, I won\&#39;t be saying &#34;blake! blake! Learn some English bitch!&#34;. On the other hand, if I was a Chinese woman and I accidentally rear-ended a Mexican woman, I won\&#39;t say &#34;Mexicans are bad drivers&#34; in front of her face. That\&#39;s not how things work. Instead, I would give out my insurance info, say sorry, and go home and tell my fellow Chinese friends and family that Mexicans are poor drivers and make fun of them behind their backs. That is the real racism. It\&#39;s hidden and not in your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, Crash is not original unlike what some people may say. The interlocking and interweaving story lines, plots, and characters have been done before. &#34;Magnolia&#34; is a movie that does this much better than Crash did and yet, it was never nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. It had a stellar cast -- Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman (who won best Actor recently), Tom Cruise, etc. It really boggles my mind how Crash was even nominated for Best Picture.&#39;
b&#34;It&#39;s always interesting to view a horror movie after hearing so much praise from other fans. Experience has taught me that you should never generalize fan taste within a genre. My expectations of this movie were a great deal higher than my viewed opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Children Shouldn&#39;t Play With Dead Things is a movie with a good intended plot that trips up too many times to carry it out. The whole idea of a band of actors staging a reanimation of dead corpses had me intrigued. However, everything degenerated into cinematic chaos. The actors,who for the most part were competent and amazingly expressive, were offered roles that fail to maintain consistent characterization. Some of these characters go from ambivalence about the whole act of defiling a cemetery, to outspoken criticism, back to ambivalence. It&#39;s one thing for characters to have a change heart in the course of the film; it&#39;s another to produce an overly dynamic, circular attitude that loops every ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another inconsistent element of this film is the premise. Does the main protagonist intend for the ceremony to be theatrical prank or does he actually conspire with dark spiritual forces to raise the dead? Even with the aforementioned flaws, I would recommend this movie to other horror fans, since I believe that only true horror fans will appreciate the dark atmospheric components and be able to ignore the plot&#39;s inconsistency. The scene where the dead rise out of the grave is made extremely haunting (even to a veteran zombie enthusiast) by the excellent combined use of scenery and sound, and the great choice of skilled actors chosen to play the reanimated dead. Current filmmakers should learn from CSPWDT about using the proper video and audio techniques in mood development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you are zombie movie completionist like me, you should take time to locate and view this movie. It&#39;s a fun watch.&#34;
b&#34;The idea of nine stupid prisoners escaping and going on a road trip sounds pretty good for a movie. Especially because it&#39;s meant to be funny and I guess heart-warming in some weird way. The problem is, the movie was very rarely funny and often just seemed pointless and needlessly gross. It was as if jokes or interesting scenes were being set up again and again but no one bothered finishing any of them--there was just no payoff. Also, the movie was just brainless and had the crooks meandering across Japan even though they left so many crime victims alive that it&#39;s impossible to believe they wouldn&#39;t have been caught almost immediately--especially since they continued to keep using the same stolen camper for days on end. And as far as being gross goes, I just didn&#39;t need to see scene after scene after scene of guys peeing along the side of the road. Plus, believe it or not, there is a scene where four of the guys are out raping sheep!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I really hated this movie. And it&#39;s a shame, as I almost always love Japanese films--just not poorly made and uninteresting ones like this one.&#34;
b&#39;I am a gigantic fan of both Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, but this movie is just not good. The reviewer below is entirely correct that the stunning imagery of the Detroit station is the first and last memorable scene in the film. I really, really wish I had left after that, instead of continuing to hold out hope throughout the film. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I felt let down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The score is almost completely a rehash of the previous two - not necessarily a bad thing if you\&#39;re a fan, but there\&#39;s only one piece that stood out to me as being fresh. It was good enough, though, that I\&#39;ll still probably check out the soundtrack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just keep this in mind if you see this film: if you come to realize at any point that you\&#39;re not enjoying it, go ahead and split - you won\&#39;t miss a thing, because it won\&#39;t get any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;ll even give the executive summary here (warning! spoilers!): lots of shots of athletes that look almost good enough for a Nike commercial, shots of smiling people, inexplicably dull frontal head shots of famous people\&#39;s wax dummies (WTF were they thinking here?!?), some giggling babies (cuuuuute), some &#34;bitchin\&#39;&#34; Photoshop effects, some imagery that\&#39;s meant to suggest a comparison between the flows of water, information, money and people (I think)... and then a bunch of quick unrelated scenes of mass violence... and then a bunch of stock space footage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could remake this movie in 10 seconds. Here\&#39;s my pitch:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 seconds of a happy daddy with a shaved head and lycra biking shorts playing with a toddler playing with a kitten playing with string; 5 seconds of that scene in &#34;Network&#34; where the guy talks about messing with the &#34;elemental forces of nature&#34; and how &#34;money flows in, money flows out;&#34; 1 second of Reginald Denny getting brained with a brick, and then 3 seconds of Alan Bean bouncing around on the moon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you go - that\&#39;s 88 minutes and 50 seconds of your life I just saved. Of course, I\&#39;d get a copy of After Effects and apply a filter or two, so it wouldn\&#39;t look as blatantly stock as it is. If Steven Soderbergh\&#39;s reading this, hey, I won\&#39;t even need much money for this project...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you insist upon watching a movie about &#34;Life as War,&#34; I suggest &#34;Bowling for Columbine&#34; instead. It may not have the pseudo-intellectual veneer so fashionable among the black turtleneck crowd, but at least it\&#39;s funny.&#39;
b&#34;Mel Welles, you might remember him as Mr. Mushnick in Roger Corman&#39;s Little Shop of Horrors, directs this somewhat interesting yet wholly twisted tale of Dr. Frankenstein&#39;s daughter carrying on her father&#39;s work after his death and creating a creature not for its intellectual ability or its likelihood to be/do good but rather for its sex appeal. You see, Tania Frankenstein, though a doctor and scientist in her own right, is concerned with really nothing more than satiating her primal desires for the stable boy and making some super sex slave by using his body with the excellent brain of a man she does not love. The story is tissue-thin here, and one gets what one might expect: lots of leering and suggestive comments(surprisingly most from the female lead), special effects that are not so special, acting that lacks depth of characterization, and not really much action or suspense. And while this film is almost barren in regards to good storytelling, Lady Frankenstein does oddly have some aspects which make it watchable - not highly watchable but watchable nonetheless. Italian actress Rosalba Neri AKA Sara Bay/Bey plays the Baron&#39;s daughter with some aplomb and lots and lots of sex appeal. She oozes desire and seduction quite well. Her performance is pretty one-dimensional, but she is quite lovely and plays over-the-top a little too well. She is also very open with her performance if you catch my drift. Poor Joseph Cotten, now regulated to European horror films for money, plays the father in a brief yet competent performance. He is the star attraction but gone before the film really kicks into a gear. As for the rest of the cast, Paul Muller is somewhat effective as Dr. Charles Marshall, the baron&#39;s assistant and an admirer of the daughter for some time. As crimes and missing persons begin to unfold in the village, policeman(I wasn&#39;t buying this)Mickey Hargitay starts to pump Tania for answers - despite what you might think not to her satisfaction. Where the movie really loses credibility is in the final third of the film where the suspect script, weak performances, and lackluster direction all head further South. The creature is revealed and looks quite ridiculous. The film ends somewhat abruptly with one of the hasty resolutions very common in the 1970s. While not nearly as bad and repulsive as some might want you to think, Lady Frankenstein is indeed a very flawed film with some perverse albeit intriguing overtones.&#34;
b&#34;My best guess is this piece of work will come out on DVD sometime before Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie was terrible. The time line jumps all over the place. This wouldn&#39;t be so bad if it left some suspense for the end. It was entirely predictable. Bitch girls pick on outcast, outcast wants to know why they hate her so much, bitch girls die a terrible death, outcast girl goes home and looks crazy. Outcast girl brought evil spirits with her, makes neighbors go crazy and kill each other. Creepy kid understands what&#39;s going on. Oh, and the younger sister not being good enough for Mommie, sick mother sending younger daughter to bring the golden child home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, there were some great moments here and there. First of all, Sarah Michelle Geller&#39;s character dies in the first few minutes. Definite plus. Didn&#39;t see that one coming. I didn&#39;t expect the wife to pour bacon grease on her husband&#39;s head, either. If the movie had kept up those kind of thrills, I would have loved it. The beginning showed so much promise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed because I enjoyed the first one. It made me jump, I didn&#39;t expect most of what happened, and though I questioned some of the movie, it was still a fun watch. I didn&#39;t watch any previews for this the sequel, because I wanted to be surprised. I was, but in the wrong direction.&#34;
b&#39;Notwithstanding that &#34;The House of Adam&#34; is meant to be a mainstream gay movie; that Anthony (John Shaw), who is gay curious and a major cutie-hunk and Adam (Jared Cadwell) who is openly gay, and a close second in looks; that there is a whole minute of wonderful, convincing, and naked lovemaking (sorry, no frontal) between Anthony and Adam 41 minutes into the movie (that alone may be sufficient for many of us) --- notwithstanding all that (to which I give a thumbs up), &#34;The House of Adam&#34; is a horrible movie by most any other movie making standard. A big thumbs down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaw\&#39;s and Cadwell\&#39;s acting abilities are either sophomoric or else truly suffer from the bad script, direction, and editing, or rather the lack thereof. Their lovemaking scene is nevertheless convincing, and may have more to do with their really being into each other, considering the rest of their scripting and acting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writer-director Jorge Amer\&#39;s (Bonus Feature) self-congratulation as to his movie making skills is off the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the script and lack thereof is a thumbs down. Overall, the acting is thumbs down with just the slightest exception for Shaw and Cadwell. Alexis Karriker as Nina might have been the best except for the limitations expressed above. Far and away the absolute worst, and insufferable, acting was by Thomas Michael Kappier as Albert Ross, Anthony\&#39;s father having not even of elementary school acting quality. He truly represents a colossal casting failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actors playing the new cabin owners are worthy of truly bad acting nominations as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only the production, editing and post production were as good as the trailer, this movie would have been quite something else. The trailer presents well put together clips of scenes that drew me into renting the movie in the first place. That, and the hope that this gay-centered movie, was supposedly prominently played and touted at gay film festivals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the movie is a big thumbs down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it worth buying/renting and watching it? Only if you have an irresistible yen to see the naked love making scene, and a few minutes of semi-convincing dialogue between Anthony and Adam. Or if you truly just enjoy watching bad movies.&#39;
b&#39;So I give it one star for true quality, but I\&#39;d give it an eight and a half for sheer enjoyability. An incredibly strange hybrid of sex comedy and vigilante thriller, &#34;Young Warriors&#34; is just the sort of bad movie you usually hope to find when poking around the video fringe, yet so rarely do. It starts off with about half an hour of wacky hi-jinx, sex jokes, and juvenile shenanigans (including an olive in the martini joke that has to be seen not to be believed). Then the main character\&#39;s younger sister gets gang raped by a bunch of swarthy bikers (an objectionable scene that keeps me from giving this a 10 for entertainment value - rape is not entertainment!), and the main character gets the rest of his sex crazed frat brothers to help him in a quest to clean up the city, find the responsible bikers, and kill anybody slightly criminal they run into along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s hilarious, non-stop fun, apart from the very unpleasant rape scene, and is essential viewing to any serious bad movie fan. Trust me - I\&#39;ve put my time in on these things, and this is one of the best. Highlights include a wonderful visit to the library, a great flickering slo-mo shootout in a sleazy bar (with a shot of a guy blowing his own foot off that\&#39;s pretty impressive), a couple of decent slumming actors (Richard Roundtree, Ernest Borgnine), a couple of semi-famous recognizable faces (Lynda Day George, scream queen Linnea Quigley), and a couple of relatives of famous people (Chuck Norris\&#39; brother Mike, Van Patten clan member James). It even has one of those great &#34;What have we become?&#34; type morality lesson endings, although the turning point comes when the vigilante fratboys gun down a couple of kids robbing a store with a toy gun. I\&#39;ve always wondered why that was the catalyst that got the hero thinking; after all, whether they were kids and not hardened criminals, and whether they had a real gun or not, they were in fact still robbing a store, so as far as I can tell, it was just another job well done for our vigilante frat boys, right? Wonderful stuff. Highly recommended, just don\&#39;t blame me when you enjoy it despite yourself.&#39;
b&#34;One of the worst movies I&#39;ve ever seen. Yes, I know I&#39;m not the target audience. Target audience is females, either college age or middle aged or any aged I guess. I&#39;m none of these so the makers don&#39;t mind if I don&#39;t like it. But that won&#39;t excuse the fact that the dialogue and the plot are horrible. The main character, Phoebe, goes on a journey to Europe to find out what happened to her sister, Faith, who committed suicide. Phoebe is an inane character that i hope no one identifies with. Faith is also a character with very little believability. Wolf is the only person who seems to be somewhat reasonable. As I said the dialogue is boring and uninteresting. The plot does completely stupid things at times. The absolute worst is that Phoebe and Faith&#39;s father is an artist but his paintings are completely dreadful. There is nothing new, interesting or refreshing in this movie. If your a guy, you will pray for the ending. If your a chick you might be able to sit through it but you will be unimpressed.&#34;
b&#39;&#34;This film is great! I watched it with some friends and we thought it was proof that a film doesn\&#39;t have to see commercial success to be a hit!&#34; ...is what I would love to be able to say about this film. In the words of the film itself &#34;you are very very bad!&#34; I went to see an unlicensed acupuncturist once so generally agree with the moral of the film though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i\&#39;d include a spoiler, but the lack of plot makes this very tricky. overall, a cinematic disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;quotes; \&#39;you\&#39;re not a leper at all!\&#39; \&#39;you\&#39;re beautiful, and i bet you\&#39;re nice too\&#39; \&#39;have you ever seen a naked man\&#39;s body?\&#39; \&#39;you couldn\&#39;t break a piece of straw.\&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cameos in dubbing; Micheal cane x3, harold bishop, steve erwine, benjamin netinyahoo, yoda.&#39;
b&#39;The prior comments are way to generous. This movie is a waste of electricity and plastic. On the other hand, I have had a great deal of fun giving it to friends to watch and describing it beforehand as &#34;beyond belief!&#34; &#34;no words can express how I feel about this&#34; &#34;This movie will move you&#34; As expected, the friends took these nondescript comments as enthusiastic endorsements. They were wrong. The sadistic pleasure I had foisting this on people was well worth the $5 I paid for the movie. On the other hand, one (former) friend says I owe him 90 minutes of his life back. I particularly enjoyed the &#34;gun\&#39;s eye view&#34; of parts of the movie. Truly awesome in it\&#39;s absurdity.&#39;
b&#34;This movie is too stupid for words. Even if you consider it to be a parody on movie-making, if you consider it to be completely camp, even than you&#39;re wasting your time watching it - for you&#39;ve seen it a hundred times before. But maybe you are a big fan of high shrieking girl voices, you&#39;re still loving Barbie and Ken and you can stand this typical &#39;80s electric guitar background noise... Well, than you&#39;ll have a chance.&#34;
b&#39;I\&#39;d never thought that I would be caught saying this: But I think &#34;Dog the Bounty Hunter&#34; is more entertaining than this 90\&#39;s era cop drama. Walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of &#34;High Octane&#34; cop shows such as CSI, CSI: Miami, and so forth. I\&#39;m not saying all these shows are bad, but they aren\&#39;t good either. I like the karate chop action that Walker dispenses on the enemies of justice, and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the CSI series. But there are some elements that I hate in a show like this. Stereotypes/Countertypes! That\&#39;s right, Stereotypes/Countertypes! Unfortunately, this is a show for the moderates of Red State America who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime. For example, there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into Dallas where he encounters group of kids in Goth/Punk clothing and they start harassing him. Now! This is exactly what Middle America perceives the Goth/Punk culture. I mean come on, how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business. Whenever there are Blacks and Latinos in the plot it\&#39;s always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood. Okay! Not everyone who\&#39;s a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime, drugs, poverty. Again, this is what Middle Red State America sees of these people. Finally, Why is the Trivette the bumbling sidekick, can\&#39;t you make the sidekick an equal ass-kicker?&#39;
b&#34;The recent DVD release of Good Humor Man labels the film as comedy. It&#39;s hardly a comedy, rather a dull indie film about a group of losers. Supposedly set in the 70s, there is scant attention paid to period details, with overly muted color correction taking its place. The monotonous soundtrack only serves to accentuate the repetitiveness of the film (perhaps that is the point, but it does not add to the enjoyment of the viewing experience.) Apprarently the clique of losers only like to hang out at one location, the bleachers. It seems like the packaging of the film as a comedy is meant to deceive people into renting or buying this film, which is a complete waste of time.&#34;
b&#39;After just viewing the movie, I must say this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. This takes my worst movie award away from Komodo, which is no easy feat. It is neither a porno nor a legitimate film and it gives them both a bad name. The acting, camera-work, plot, script, and sound are all awful. My personal favorite part of the movie is the duck asking the bartender if he has any grapes. Why was a joke such as this put in the film? Was the director thinking; &#34;I need a humorous scene to balance out the great acting so I will use some lame ass joke I read on a Laffy Taffy wrapper.&#34; Another retarded part is when Norman spills the invisibility potion on himself as he attempts to keep it from spilling. Why did they even bother to give the film a NC-17 rating, were they hoping to get as large of an audience as possible? At least if it were rated X it would be more sexual and therefore taking the viewers focus away from the overall low quality. I pray for someone who worked on this panty waste of a flick to respond.&#39;
b&#39;I saw this film shortly after watching Moonlight &amp; Valentino with Elizabeth Perkins, Gwyneth Platrow, Whoopi Goldberg and Kathleen Turner. There are a lot of similarities between the two films. They both have great casts and good acting. They both have stock characters of sisters who are very different, an offensive stepmother, a woman friend/confidant, an emotionally unavailable father, a dead mother and a surprise lover. Both films have the characters experience life-changing realizations and both films suffer from a kind of \&#39;love conquers all\&#39; sentimentality. They both add a little titillation with Cameron Diaz in black underwear and a partial back shot of Gwyneth Paltrow naked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both films seem contrived, as if the writers of the works the films are based on did market research and said, &#34;Ok, there\&#39;s a market for stories about relationships between women, so I\&#39;m going to write about two sisters with an offensive stepmother\xc2\x85&#34; In other words, instead of the drama emerging from the truth of the relationship, the relationship is invented to fit the dramatic situation. It seems forced, the characters don\&#39;t seem real, the relationships are unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The resolution of the tensions between the characters is simplistic with simple apologies completely whisking away years of acrimony leaving everyone feeling warm and fuzzy ever after. It\&#39;s just not real. Romantic fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The characters in In Her Shoes are a little more overblown than Moonlight &amp; Valentino, especially the stepmother part. Sydelle Feller is so evil that it is difficult to believe that the father would stay with her, or even marry her in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you liked Moonlight &amp; Valentino you will probably like In Her Shoes as well. Enjoyable performances in both, in fact, the actors bring depth to their parts that goes way beyond the contrived sentimentality of the scripts.&#39;
b&#39;I love most Jet Li movies (with the exception of Romeo Must Die) and I bought this movie in a VERY cheap three-pack with &#34;The Master&#34; and &#34;Twin Warriors&#34;. While Twin Warriors was very impressive and I was thoroughly intrigued by it, and the master was a bit &#34;Karate Kid&#34; but also enjoyable, I thought this movie was TERRIBLE. I\&#39;m not just saying that because I\&#39;m used to better movies. I\&#39;m saying that it was almost down there with &#34;Kazaam&#34;. The fight scenes were terrible (blurry cameras and no real fighting) and the plot was your typical &#34;stupid kung-fu plot&#34;. If you are going to have a plot this stupid (see \&#39;man turns into woman to become all-powerful then falls in love with Jet Li\&#39;) you best have some great fighting to go with it. If you are looking for an original HK Jet Li movie, I suggest you go rent &#34;Shaolin Temple 2&#34; (aka Kids from Shaolin).&#39;
b&#39;This story is about a safari in Africa that meets some guy named Trent--who convinces them to look for a tribe of white babes. Naturally, they turn out to be amazon warriors and capture the men. The rest is pretty predictable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie has everything you\&#39;d expect in a bargain basement movie about Africa--the substantial use of often irrelevant stock footage, film of animals that are NOT native to the continent (such as Orangutans, Moose, Coatamundis and Ground Hogs),a white actor in dark makeup playing a native, bad acting (particularly from Trent--a handsome man with the personality of balsa wood), comic relief (sounding like Chico Marx), a guy dressed up in a gorilla suit and bikini-clad white women with perms who are supposedly fierce jungle warriors--like a tribe of angry female Tarzans. By the look of it, my assumption is that the movie was made for under $49.95--including developing costs and paying for rental of the gorilla suit! But, what I didn\&#39;t expect was an IMDb score of 4.9. This is poor, but not that poor considering that this is a schlock production in every possible sense and there is no conceivable reason why the film is rated that high! Now I am NOT saying the film isn\&#39;t worth seeing--it\&#39;s campy and stupid enough to make enjoyable viewing--particularly with friends. Just don\&#39;t expect anything resembling a professionally made or competent film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, here\&#39;s a smattering of the dialog from this jungle classic:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Oolama like strong white man. Oolama want strong white man...&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;oonga-bunga&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;me-te-tonga....no,....keeel (\&#39;kill\&#39;) man&#34;&#39;
b&#39;for me,this is not a good TV show,animated or otherwise.it is however,annoying to the nth degree.there are a few reasons for this,in no particular order.first,the intro of one of the most pointless,and annoying characters ever,Batmite.this character serves no purpose for the show,whatsoever.maybe it is intended as comic relief,but it doesn\&#39;t work out that way.next up,the Joker.i thought it was really ridiculous to have his character let loose with that ridiculous laugh after almost every sentence.talk about repetitive.this gets old really fast..also don\&#39;t think the had the right actor to voice the character.it just doesn\&#39;t sound at all like the joker should sound.lastly,they made Robin look like a complete dork.other than these problems,the show isn\&#39;t that bad.but these are big enough problems to drastically lower the likability factor.for me,&#34;The new adventures Of Batman&#34; is a 3/10,at best.&#39;
b&#39;This one is a real stinker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story just isn\&#39;t up to par with most other TZ episodes. It\&#39;s pretty boring, though seeing Peter Falk made up as a Fidel Castro lookalike is kind of amusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever Twilight Zone would be aired at an unannounced hour in my hometown, I\&#39;d grab a sandwich and a drink and settle in for some quality entertainment. 9 times out of 10, it wound up being THIS episode! Strange thing? This often happened to my mom (another TZ fan like me) as well. There were so many times that one of us would say to the other, &#34;I was all set to watch _The Twilight Zone_ and guess which episode was on? The Cuban Dictator episode!&#34; Obviously some people like this episode, as it gets a 6.7 rating ... how that happened, I have no idea - but THAT in and of itself would make a great Twilight Zone plot!&#39;
b&#39;Last fall (of 2001), I took a film class that was taught by the director of this movie (Mark Hoeger). His vast knowledge of filmmaking, his ability to dissect any scene of a film, and his winning of an Academy Award in some obscure category seemed to give him more credibility than your average independent film director. When he mentioned during one of his classes that he had just finished directing a film called &#34;Full Ride&#34; and was in the post-production stages, my interest was piqued. However, that would be the last I would ever hear of that film project. Until last week...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week, I saw in a TV listing that &#34;Full Ride&#34; was going to be showing on the WB network. This immediately raised a red flag, as I can\&#39;t help but associate WB with teensploitation shows such as Dawson\&#39;s Creek, Charmed, etc. PLUS, the fact that Full Ride was going to be released straight to TV wasn\&#39;t too flattering in itself. But, nevertheless, I set aside that time and sat down to watch my former film teacher\&#39;s creation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two hours passed and the end credits began to roll, I thought long and hard about what I had just seen. What I had just seen was a typical WB-quality show stretched out to the length of two hours. In fact, it almost seemed as if this movie was made with the sole intent of only showing on the WB network. Critiquing this movie will basically be like critiquing a typical WB show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where to begin? The characters are shallow, the story is cliche in every sense of the word, the scenes are completely contrived, and the character development is forced and unbelievable. This movie just screams `unoriginal.\&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main character, Matt Sabo, is some hot shot from the wrong side of the tracks (literally) who plays solid high school football as a fullback, but then fizzles off into a life of crime. He is then offered a chance at a full ride scholarship instead of going to jail. Obviously, without much of a choice, he agrees to play football with an all-star football team, but is not excepted among his peers because of his poor team spirit and bad attitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then comes the love interest. Of course! Where would this predictable fanfare be without a love interest? She comes in the form of Amy Lear (played by the beautiful Meredith Monroe). She is actually a likable character, as opposed to the ever-so-abrasive Matt Sabo, so we almost applaud her when she rejects him at first. But, of course, the inevitable comes to pass. She falls for him, changes his attitude towards everything, and all seems good and happy. But now it\&#39;s time for conflict!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier in the movie, Amy makes it clear to Matt that she doesn\&#39;t want to score with him, because it would be `shameful\&#39; to her and her mother. This is much to Matt\&#39;s dismay, and his football buddies (yes, they eventually warm up to him) who bet him he wouldn\&#39;t get any. But, of course, Matt eventually comes to accept these terms and decides he\&#39;s not all about the nookie. Here\&#39;s where the exciting plot thickens. If you don\&#39;t want me to ruin this surprise, then skip ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[BEGIN SPOILER]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt finds out from some local guys that apparently Amy Lear always tries to score with a guy each year from the All-Star team so that she can try to use him to escape her small town life of working in a cafeteria (which is baffling in the first place) and make it to the big city. Suddenly realizing he\&#39;s been used and that his love was a sham, Matt it tempted to turn back to a life of crime and leave the football camp before `the big game.\&#39; Amy tries to reassure him that she was really in love this time, but he\&#39;s too hot-headed to buy it. So what will Matt do? Will he take her back? Or will he go back to robbing gas stations and being an all-round jerk? I won\&#39;t ruin the super-ultra-surprising ending for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[END SPOILER]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if I somehow got you pumped up for this movie, please realize that that was my sarcasm and not genuine enthusiasm. This movie is an uninspired version of `Varsity Blues\&#39; or `Summer Catch.\&#39; And that\&#39;s not saying much. There\&#39;s hardly any comedy to save it and the characters are too shallow to care about. So what do you have left? Not a whole lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I most disliked about the movie was how much of an unflattering picture Hoeger painted of Nebraska through this film. It seems like he was trying to capture the essence of rural Nebraska and teenage life in the small towns, but his approach is all too stereotypical and shallow. The characters\&#39; high hopes for making in `the big city\&#39; and the actions they take to do so are greatly exaggerated, and it only further cements the stereotype of Nebraskans being a bunch of hicks living in farm communities. I am unsure of whether or not Hoeger\&#39;s intentions were good in trying to put his home state in the spotlight, but I think he ended up with a very shameful product. If Hoeger wanted to portray Nebraska in a favorable light, he should have taken a note or two from Alexander Payne. While Payne simply chooses to use Nebraska as a backdrop for his films, Hoeger integrates it into the plot of Full Ride and becomes so entangled in his awareness of where he\&#39;s shooting, that he ends up churning out superficial garbage that would seem to come from an outsider. If Hoeger actually lived here, you\&#39;d think he\&#39;d know better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am completely disappointed in Hoeger\&#39;s first big film, and I hope that next time he can combine his knowledge with a little bit of originality to create something different and thought-provoking.&#39;
b&#34;It&#39;s just when a band tours, and only has one original member. It&#39;s not the same as the classic line up. All new actors playing the main roles of Rag, Scotty, etc, with Ashby as virtually the only returning face from the first movie. And he was of only minor note of the first flick, serving as the only redeemable group of the three guys that Scotty was trying to assist in meeting females. The film is poorly written, featuring the dumbest dialog this side of Armageddon. Even for a T&amp;A movie, this one is a turkey. Not even die hard low budget 80&#39;s films fans would want to sit through this movie, which has no plot, and plenty of bad acting. This film would have been better off never being released. Just plain bad.&#34;
b&#39;So, this starts with at least an interesting and promising basic idea, goes on and on with tension, Carey in a good untypical role but in a less than you expected performance, weak direction from Joel Schumacher match with some plot holes, the &#34;detective scenes&#34; show us the luck of creativity. If you don\&#39;t have great expectations (because of the negative reviews) maybe you will enjoy this . At the end they offer to us a lesson about morality (for those who remember &#34;Falling Down&#34;) and the &#34;Family Joy and Cure&#34; that ruins every possibility to be kind and find the film watchable P.S. It\&#39;s obvious who is the &#34;killer&#34;! I wonder why W.Sparrow (Carey) didn\&#39;t resolve the mystery from the beginning of the film...&#39;
b&#34;Let&#39;s just say that it might be the worst movie I&#39;ve ever seen. On the front of the box of the movie it says something about it resembling Reservoir Dogs. I fell for it hook, line, and sinker. This is just a warning message to anyone who might read this. It&#39;s not even worth renting when you want something to laugh at.&#34;
b&#39;Terrible terrible movie for Television. Once again Lifetime brings us the predictable triangle; scheming bitchy woman out to get stupid unknowing wife of yet another stupid husband who doesn\&#39;t have a clue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get antsy when I see these films. You may ask, why do I watch them then? I haven\&#39;t a clue. Usually by mistake. And the movie is so bad I can\&#39;t get away from it. I wait for the bitch to get her come up-pence. And usually I\&#39;m not satisfied in how she gets her just desserts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if you can believe our vixen, she steals embryos from the clinic, and how does one do that? Without blood tests, DNA, inquiries and recommendations. She proceeds to kill the Realtor, Gabrielle Rose, who is on to her, in broad daylight in the front yard of a house for sale and no one sees her? She kills the mother, Susan Hogan, and you could predict that surmise when the mother off handedly mentions she\&#39;s allergic to peanuts and that the pills to combat this allergy are in her pocket book. Guess what? I won\&#39;t continue on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally you are left in the house alone with the wife and the bitch. Well good triumphs evil, but much too slowly. Victoria Pratt as the evil girlfriend is adequate in the role, looking a bit too disheveled and obvious. Tori Spelling just stands around looking blank most of the time. She\&#39;s got those big big Bette Davis eyes that look like they\&#39;re popping out of her head. I liked her better in TRICK. And Tahmoh Penikett plays the husband going around assuring his wife there\&#39;s nothing too he and his ex-girlfriend, even though he\&#39;s spotted all over town being very chummy with her, standing half naked with her in his house when he sent the wife off to the city to stay overnight. Yet he continues to deny the romance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lifetime never disappoints the viewers with their inane plots and stories about women and their stupid husbands. Wish I could give this chestnut a &#34;0&#34; rating.&#39;
b&#39;I love Lucy, but this movie is so wretchedly bad that I was squirming in embarrassment for all concerned within the first ten minutes . . . and it just got worse from there. Lucille Ball\&#39;s &#34;singing&#34; is downright painful and the attempts to make her appear more youthful through the use of soft focus had me reaching for my reading glasses. It\&#39;s bombs like this that give bombs a bad name.&#39;
b&#34;I wouldn&#39;t have given this film such a low rating (2) if its average hadn&#39;t been ridiculously high, but someone had to bring it down to something more reasonable. I sat through most of this film, watching scene after scene of tagging and shoplifting. No dialog, just tagging and shoplifting. Finally the two taggers kissed. Something happened. But then back to tagging and shoplifting. I left the screening. I recommend this film only to those who are impressed by pretentious film-making. I disliked the directors previous film (a self-righteous defense of man-boy love) but at least that film had a story, interesting characters, dialog. The Graffiti Artist had only scene after scene of tagging and shoplifting. I want more from a film than this.&#34;
b&#34;As a fan of C.J.&#39;s earlier movie, Latter Days, I really wanted to like this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nicest thing I can say, however, is that it&#39;s NOT an awful film. There are some good performances, and a few funny scenes. In particular, Tori Spelling has a couple of great scenes where she&#39;s talking to her fianc\xc3\xa9&#39;s ex-boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, it&#39;s pretty week. The script falls back on weird coincidences and clich\xc3\xa9d movie moments way too often. (The main character went to Stanford on a golf scholarship, and his high school buddy doesn&#39;t even know that he plays the game?) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the time, this movie had no idea where it was going or what it was trying to say. There are a lot of scenes that are mildly cute, but ultimately turn out to be a waste of time. And you could easily cut half the characters from the film without losing anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, for all it&#39;s faults, I would have to say that this is one of the better gay films of recent years. Which says a lot about how bad most gay films are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m hoping C.J.&#39;s next film will be better.&#34;
b&#34;In terms of quality movies, this isn&#39;t one of them. It&#39;s actually the first Chuck Norris movie I&#39;ve seen and I was left pretty underwhelmed. The fight scenes are slow and don&#39;t have a lot of variety. Norris just uses a lot of roundhouse kicks on all the bad guys coming after him which makes the fights pretty boring. The movie also is quite short, but for some reason the movie doesn&#39;t even seem finished when it ends. It&#39;s a pretty anti-climatic ending. All the same though, I&#39;ve watched a lot of bad movies, and this isn&#39;t one of the worst that I&#39;ve seen. It&#39;s worth a watch, I&#39;m guessing especially for Norris fans. There&#39;s also nothing like seeing a group of rigs hurtling down the desert which in my opinion was the highlight of the movie.&#34;
b&#34;This movie was in a box set with 20 others, with varying quality, &amp; I can safely say that this title was right at the bottom of the heap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pointless to go through the plot, what there was of it, picking out what was wrong, as I haven&#39;t got all day &amp; life is to short, which reminds me, I have just lost around 85 minutes of mine watching this tripe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting was diabolically bad in a way that made it funny, though only just, whilst the comedy elements like the two idiotic cops must have made any Laurel &amp; Hardy fans groan. One of the only barely funny moments was when the leading lady made a joke about her former friends plastic T*ts, which would have been okay if I hadn&#39;t had to watch them bob around whenever she waddled on the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lowest I can give is one, &amp; it probably deserves that for having Heather Thomas in it, as she was certainly sexy &amp; shapely, though her acting was as bad as everyone else.&#34;
b&#34;I cannot believe how this atrocity managed to capture the hearts and minds of a cross-section of the &#39;bright young things&#39; of its era, but I&#39;m certain I wish it hadn&#39;t. In my opinion it is an inaccurate, poorly acted, weakly scripted, pretentiously directed piece of gumpf. The brief outings to an imagined reality bludgeon any humour to death. The situations are unsubtle exaggerations which make the the already flimsy characters even more unbelievable and detestable. The romance is dull, the end is unsatisfying and ruins the only sensible drugs message in the film and the simple plot (&#39;Withnail and I,&#39; &#39;Fear and Loathing&#39;) is tested to extremes with the uninteresting motion of the film. In short this film as a blatant visual assault with no hint of skill or initiative. I condemn it to the ash heap of history and pray it stays there.&#34;
b&#34;i have had this movie, in the back of my head sense i saw it. i have wanted to tell people about it time and again, but never remembered. now i found it. now finally, i can tell people precisely what the absolute worst, most crappy movie i have ever seen in my entire life, bar none is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this movie is complete trash, and is unfit for a garbage dump. all prints and other copy&#39;s of this movie should be rounded up loaded into a large rocket, and launched into the sun. only the purifying heat and pressure of the sun might be able to purify the materials this movie is stored on, so that they can be useful to the universe again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like movies. i like bad movies. and yes this is an opinion. but this movie was pure trash, filth, and excrement of some beast that should never be seen let alone named by man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would rather watch a Uwe Boll Movie marathon than watch this movie. and i hate Uwe Boll&#39;s films.&#34;
b&#39;Yet again, I appear to be the only person on planet Earth who is capable of criticizing Japanese films made before 1970. &#34;Fires on the Plain&#34; (1959) is another in the seemingly endless line of &#34;classics&#34; that get all sorts of praise for no apparently good reason. As much as I love to overgeneralize and psychoanalyze all of these moviegoers who have such horrible taste in film, it\&#39;s still nearly impossible to rationalize why anyone would ever think that poorly made fluff like this should be proclaimed as some sort of &#34;masterpiece.&#34; What I find truly ironic is that fans of derivative &#34;classics&#34; like &#34;Fires on the Plain&#34; focus so much on &#34;inside the box&#34; movie-making (orthodox grading standards like scriptwriting, acting, camera-work, etc.) yet it always seems like the most highly revered &#34;classics&#34; are most deficient in these very standards. For example, one of the laziest copouts for a filmmaker involves forced verbal exposition where characters basically explain everything for the viewer even when the constructed scenario is totally artificial. Most surprisingly, the very first scene in &#34;Fires on the Plain&#34; uses this indolent tactic to the extreme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a funny head slap, the following useless dialogue assaults the viewer, &#34;Why can\&#39;t you grasp the situation? We landed to the west under heavy fire to reinforce units at Tacloban. We lost two-thirds of our men. Our artillery was sunk in transit. We tried to reach Burauen airfield by crossing the central mountains but without artillery it was impossible. The enemy\&#39;s counterattack forced a fanout across the valley. You know that.&#34; So why, exactly, is one character telling another character something he already knows? Oh yeah, that\&#39;s right, the makers of this film are too lazy to think of more natural ways to communicate this information. You see, a quality film would actually show these events happening, or at worst it would involve dialogue involving one character who has no knowledge of those events. Heck, even an opening summary in paragraph form directed at the viewer would have been better than what transpired here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such instances of poor quality movie-making are littered throughout &#34;Fires on the Plain&#34; to the point where this film feels like it was written by imbeciles for imbeciles. For example, the lead character stumbles upon some skeletons wrapped in Japanese garb. Instead of doing the natural thing like \xc2\x96 oh I don\&#39;t know \xc2\x96 giving a depressed mannerism, the character blurts out &#34;Japanese soldiers.&#34; Thanks buddy, but I could have figured that one out for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even worse, this movie is saturated with over-dramatic ploys. The most ridiculous scene involves a pair of boots. Picture this. A soldier walks along and finds a pair of worn out boots. One would think that such a find is utterly useless, but it turns out that the soldier\&#39;s boots are in even worse condition, so he picks up the worn boots and leaves his SUPER worn boots behind. Fine, I get the point. The soldiers are in rough shape \xc2\x96 a fact that is already clearly emphasized with their worn boots to begin with. The scene is ridiculous, but I was ready to let it go, until the SECOND soldier arrives! You see, he finds the previous soldier\&#39;s SUPER worn boots and notices \xc2\x96 get ready, cause here it comes \xc2\x96 that his boots are SUPER DUPER worn boots! Lucky man, he picks up the SUPER worn boots and leaves his SUPER DUPER worn boots behind. But you see, that\&#39;s not all \xc2\x96 because the THIRD soldier then arrives! He finds the previous soldiers SUPER DUPER worn boots and inspects them, along with his own SUPER DUPER worn boots. Since both pairs suck, he tosses them both aside and smiles as he continues barefoot. At this point I was ready to throw my television through my living room window. The heavy handedness, overdramaticism, and paramount absurdity of this sequence is beyond bad film-making. It\&#39;s SUPER DUPER bad film-making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a number of similar, completely stupid moments to be had. Like the time when the lead character asks someone, &#34;Hey, are you dead?&#34; Like the guy is going to answer &#34;Yes&#34; if he actually kicked the bucket. I\&#39;ll also be the first to condemn the subpar performance of the lead actor, who is the quintessential posterchild for artificial reaction. I laughed hard during that opening head slap where his head slingshot back in place with this stupid, goofy expression on his face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this trivial fluff piece gets an IMDb average rating of 8.4 while a certifiable masterpiece like &#34;A Tale of Two Sisters&#34; (2003) only gets a 7.5 is the height of mass stupidity. And to think that some people actually delude themselves into thinking that &#34;AToTS&#34; doesn\&#39;t make sense. Well, not every movie can have completely outrageous SUPER DUPER worn boots on its side.&#39;
b&#39;Sure, this film was retarded. But you expected that the moment you looked at the cover-box. It\&#39;s a B movie, and on the T&amp;A factor this movie delivered. Truthfully, it was funnier than expected. While it was by no means a work of comedic genius, like &#34;The Party Animal&#34; or &#34;Orgazmo&#34;, as far as B movies go it was worth the watch, if you\&#39;re into that sort of thing anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christians and morally-oriented parental groups, this is soft-core adult entertainment. If you don\&#39;t want your children watching sexual content and nudity, then you should keep your children away from this film.&#39;
b&#39;Am I the only one to think that this is a bad movie?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit that horror movies often lack things like a big story or good acting or even good special effects. But the way these deficiencies come together in this movie is surprisingly pitiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miserable story: The idea of a raped vagina that takes revenge by turning into a man eater sounds quite funny, but what the writer made out of it is stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad acting: The actors move like marionettes. They play and look like people, who really try hard but completely fail to act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad FX: Especially the explosion of the Van looks unspeakably cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is surprising that a director who made some nice movies during his carrier changes over to such messy stuff.&#39;
b&#34;They give you the set up then bore you to death with a constant cat and mouse chase. The main characters are involved in one constant stand-off where they threaten each other, every five minutes or less. And I&#39;d like to see the police force that would let one of their cops pull off the A. Garcia bit. It&#39;s like some local cop walking Charlie Manson out of prison to go get a cup of coffee. Get real!&#34;
b&#34;Wretched. Talk about botched. BEYOND THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE is bad in every respect. Salvagers Michael Caine and Karl Malden decide to tow the wreck of the eponymous ocean liner with a really creaky tug boat. They&#39;re challenged by ruthless Telly Savalas and his gang of machine-gun toting goons. This part sequel, part remake has Caine, Malden and ANOTHER group of Poseidon survivors making a similarly dangerous trek out of the sinking ship. Among this group are Shirley Jones, Slim Pickens, Peter Boyle, Shirley Knight and Slim Pickens. Jack Warden plays a blind man. Surely, you&#39;ll wish you were blind after seeing this mess. Sally Field is particularly annoying as a stowaway on board Caine&#39;s tug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disaster master Irwin Allen not only produced this one, he decided to direct it as well.&#34;
b&#39;This film is simply appalling, how the talent involved made this is beyond human belief.Iguess they must have been boozing when they thought of this idea,I feel as if 2 hours of my life have been taken from me.Harvey Kietel will try and distance himself from this rubbish, it should have been a great crime movie but it develops into a gory mess of vampires.I would recommend this film to people who like to sleep through movies ,you wont miss a thing.The humour is set to appeal to the lowest common dominate, movies can uplift us and remind us that life is worth living, this film just depresses you.As DeNiro said in one movie the saddest thing in life is wasted talent this film is a perfect example of this statement.&#39;
b&#34;I really wanted to like this film but it barely eked out a 3. It&#39;s surprising that equal amounts of the votes were 10, the other half 1. All the characters were entertaining and even talented but as a whole the film didn&#39;t pay off. Sebastian Hernandez is appealing; charismatic and likable (he even physically resembles Marc Anthony in a more approachable yet ultimately conscious sort of way...) but even he couldn&#39;t save this mess of a movie. Scenes dragged on far too long and points were ultimately beaten to death. The banana scene fringed on self-absorption, seemingly showing how much movement was in his boxers. But in his defense it was his first movie as director (that I&#39;m aware of) and I appreciate his labor of love. It just left me empty despite what was trying to be said. Ultimately I think the story would have been better handled by a more experienced director. From what I&#39;ve seen of the &#39;extras&#39;, there is a real story behind this and, perhaps when I finish watching them, I&#39;ll appreciate this attempt more.&#34;
b&#34;The film starts well enough. It is a truly terrifying scene as a couple of fugitives on the run from the law tear apart an innocent family living in a secluded country cottage by killing the mother and father. The young daughter only manages to escape with the aid of a mysterious spectre, who kills the two aggressors while she covers in a downstairs cupboard. Then, we catch up with her 15 years later as a drug-addled student researching the supernatural, living with her promiscuous aunt and being looked after by a mysterious redhead. She has no real friends, was almost raped at a party and keeps having bizarre visions which no-one else can see. So yep, life is grand. Things get a lot more pleasant when she has a falling out with her mum&#39;s sister, who is later found dead in a bathtub under suspicious circumstances with 11 etched into her forehead. Hmm, I wonder who the police&#39;s main suspect will be? This is quickly followed by more deaths, all linked by their relation to our heroine having been on bad terms with them before their passing. Could she be the culprit, or perhaps the explanation could be something of a more ethereal nature? Clue: If you think the former, you&#39;ve picked up the wrong movie from Blockbuster. Go back and get the correct one, short-sighted gimp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I was all ready to fast-forward to the good parts, safe in the knowledge that I wasn&#39;t missing out on anything but a mediocre suspense potboiler. But the first ten minutes grabbed me, and I decided to give it a chance. I was quite pleasantly surprised: it certainly wasn&#39;t a masterpiece but the acting was good enough and the script kept throwing up intriguing situations of which I looked forward to finding the solution to. Alas, 45 minutes in, I realised my attention start to wander during a long sequence where the main character is walking round a library, doing nothing. We then get a cheap scare, followed by quarter of an hour of goddledegook about the paranormal between her and her new hunk of a boyfriend. Things only got worse from there, as the promising beginning is thrown out the window as we get one unconvincing plot twist after another, followed by an ending so anti-climatic it&#39;s like being promised the moon and ending up with a teeny weeny meteorite instead. Pathetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it was bad all the way through, it would have been far easier to swallow. The fact that it starts at a canter and barely ends with a whimper is not just disappointing, it is heartbreaking. How can something which began so promisingly end up being so formulaic? I don&#39;t know, and I don&#39;t particularly care. I&#39;ll just give the writer and director a bit of advice for next time: Don&#39;t spend 5 weeks writing the first part of your screenplay, then 5 minutes finishing the rest. You tend to notice these things in the final product when you treat your project as sloppily as you have here... 3/10&#34;
b&#34;Its hard to decide where to begin.I bought this for a few quid and its the worst few quid Iv ever wasted. The back of the DVD had no pictures and a few lines plot summary, this should have warned me, but I usually like bad movies for a laugh so decided to give it a go. The movie is made up of three short stories,each revolving around someone who was on a particular bus at one point.(its never made clear what the significance of the bus is, or what city its set in)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POSSIBLE SPOILERS(as if there is anything to be spoiled) The first story is about a man who is persuaded, by a car, to purcahse it, against his wife&#39;s wishes.The car is sort of like a demonic Brum and takes over his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second is about a slob of a man who never cleans his fridge and a monster bacteria man grows out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third about a woman who goes to a dating agency, only to discover her date isnt all that normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inbetween these, we are treated to shots of the bus(or A bus anyway) while a narrator whittles on a load of garbage about relationships(really,its like he is on commission for saying &#39;relationships&#39;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie actually has no redeeming features whatsoever.The acting, the costumes and the little Spfx are all disgusting.There arent even any attractive female cast members to admire.Simply put, this movie is a debacle.&#34;
b&#39;Greetings All,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isn\&#39;t it amazing the power that films have on you after the 1st viewing ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so delighted by the first viewing of this film, I couldn\&#39;t stop talking about &#34;Flatliners&#34; to all my friends for weeks - mind you I was a very impressionable 18 year old back then and my taste in films have become a little more conservative since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then somehow I forgot about this film until I saw the DVD in my local department store and remembering how great it was I thought &#34;Right ! I\&#39;ll pluck you off the shelf when they bring out the Special Edition&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week, I was overjoyed when my best friend invited me over to watch Flatliners on DVD. The expectation was that I would love this film even more on 2nd viewing.. How wrong I was !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: after 11 years my view on this film had changed from a very scary 1st class movie to total junk which overplays on the religious and supernatural side of things ratherly superficially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been a big fan of Julia Roberts\&#39; acting (excepting for Erin Brockeridge in which she deserved her Oscar) I think the problem with this film definitely lies with the director and a so so mediocre script. I left this film feeling it had no real substance or potential, and just a couple of scarey cheap thrills which weren\&#39;t very well done at all. Not even the score by James-Newtown Howard, who I rather like as a film composer, could captivate and thrill me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1990 I would have given this film 9.5 / 10; but in 2001 I\&#39;d be lucky to give it 2 / 10 at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;
b&#34;One only has to read the cast list and credits to salivate in anticipation of this DAVID COPPERFIELD, but, alas, alas! How so much major acting and directorial talent could have turned one of literature&#39;s richest tales into such a monumental BORE, is totally beyond me. It&#39;s pretty to look at with lovely photography, particularly the Yarmouth sequences, but, JUST PLAIN DULL!!! No need to go on! Skip it and check out the Selznick or the marvelous BBC mini-series from the 1980&#39;s.&#34;
b&#34;A friend of mine, who is even more into 1970s cult films than myself, recommended this one to me and in fact gave me the copy of it that I watched. However, I was not as enthusiastic about the result as he \xc2\x96 or, for that matter, Michael Elliott \xc2\x96 was. The film is a hybrid of HOUSE OF WAX (1953) and THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE (1974): indeed, I would venture to say that it served as the basis of the 2005 remake of the former much more than the &#39;original&#39; did! So, we have a remote and derelict Wax Museum of incredibly lifelike dummies (guess why that is?) with its apparently harmless curator (a hammy Chuck Connors) being &#39;invaded&#39; by the obligatory group of stranded teenagers (among them Tanya Roberts). He also has a mad brother \xc2\x96 shades of PSYCHO (1960) incorporated for good measure, down to the self-same twist \xc2\x96 who is supposed to be a mechanical genius (showcased in a &#39;poltergeist&#39; which unaccountably accompanies the first murder). The film does benefit from a Pino Donaggio score but, being so derivative and not especially well made to boot, essentially ends up merely a redundant (and fairly muddled) genre effort.&#34;
b&#34;While trying to build a major mall or complex or something like that, a wealthy landowner ignores ancient Native American artifacts buried on the land, and unleashes the Bone Eater...a creature who goes around and kills people in search of his fallen friends or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed this movie had to be a Sci-Fi Channel original. If it wasn&#39;t, then the director should never direct anything again. The effects in the film is laughable at best, and the Bone Eater monster is nothing but a CGI-animated being added into the frames at a later date. The actors don&#39;t even look all that frightened when they see the thing (probably because they really don&#39;t, and they&#39;re just terrible actors). It&#39;s a great comedy, though, even if it&#39;s supposed to be pure horror.&#34;
b&#39;I remember this movie with feelings of sheer . . . agony. More than half of the film is commercials (no, really!). The slight excuse for a story could easily have been told in 25 minutes (and almost is!) The end result is a prefab love story of predictable schlock, all obviously thrown together in a crassly commercial attempt to wring a few more bucks from the contemporary Debbie Boone hit. Yep, that\&#39;s how fast it was produced... the song that &#34;inspired&#34; it was still big on the charts when the film was released!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite decades of seeing bad movies, this one still impresses me for its extravagant, no-holds-barred, headlong jump into the most tedious, absurd, and indelible cinematic badness. It truly deserves to be on the IMDb list of the 100 worst of all time, and has never left the top 3 on my personal &#34;worst&#34; list. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy it for the sheer masochistic thrill!&#39;
b&#39;Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. My lifetime was drastically wasted by this pile of stink. I would rather chew off my arm than watch this film again. Painful story line, painful characters and a painful two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way of describing this movie is a follows:- I would rather stick pins in my eyes and cut out my brain than watch another minute of this tripe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice is to stay well clear and let your local dustman do you a favour of removing this rubbish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lin, you told me this was good!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goodaleebyeload.&#39;
b&#34;An absolutely atrocious adaptation of the wonderful children&#39;s book. Crude and inappropriate humor, some scary parts, and a sickening side story about the mom&#39;s boyfriend wanting to send the boy away to military school to get him out of the way makes this totally inappropriate for the kids who will most likely want to see it because of the book (3-8) yr olds. Don&#39;t waste your money, your time, or your good judgement.&#34;
b&#34;I have always been a fan of Bottom, grabbing as many videos as I could find of the series here in the states. The chemistry between Rik and Ade is always genius, and the combination of smart writing and utterly stupid humor seems to work without fail. I thus sat down to watch this movie with great eagerness... and was utterly disappointed by the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first 3/4 of the movie can best be described as uninspired and poorly directed (sorry, Ade!), but with some utterly brilliant moments. Unfortunately, these laugh-out-loud moments make you realize how less-than-brilliant the rest of the movie is. The slapstick starts off funny but eventually becomes a bit boring, with only the perverted sex jokes to keep things humorous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end of the movie (the &#39;green&#39; scenes, for those of you who&#39;ve seen it) was... perhaps the worst ending I&#39;ve seen in the past decade. Honestly. It was one joke repeated about thirty times, followed by an abrupt ending that made no sense (which didn&#39;t bother me) and wasn&#39;t funny (which did).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, I was sorely disappointed by this movie. I shall cling to the few brilliant moments in it, to retain the fondest memories that I can... but I have to warn you, if you&#39;re about to overpay for your NTSC conversion tape from the local importer, don&#39;t. There are far better things to spend your money on.&#34;
b&#34;It&#39;s hard to believe that a movie this bad wasn&#39;t produced once, but four times! Most movies require a certain `suspension of reality&#39; to enjoy, but this one takes it just too far. The basic scenario is an Air Force pilot who is shot down over a `Middle Eastern&#39; country. The US government drags its feet in recovering him, leading the Pilot&#39;s son (Doug Masters) to attempt a rescue mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I have with the movie is that it depicts the US Air Force as one colossal joke. In the movie you&#39;ll find that Doug and his friends on the air base manage to secure two F-16&#39;s, all the munitions, the fuel, the Intel for the mission, and so on. Security on this base seems to be a joke. Nobody seems to have a problem that a sixteen-year-old kid is fully qualified to pilot an F-16!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that wasn&#39;t enough, you would think the producers would at least attempt to get the munitions right, since people like to see things `blow up&#39;. Not so! Several times in the movie, Doug fires off AIM-9 Missiles on ground targets. AIM stands for `Air Intercept Missile&#39;, meaning a weapon used to strike targets in the AIR. He also fires off 15-20 missiles, where the maximum an F-16 can hold is 6 AIM-9&#39;s. The movie also lacks continuity. You&#39;ll see the aircraft configured with one set of munitions, and in the next scene, it has a totally different munitions package. Also, 20MM doesn&#39;t just completely destroy anything it touches! An F-16 will hold 500 rounds of 20MM, and it&#39;s mostly used for self-defense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on forever with plot holes, flaws, and outright wrong information from the movie, but I won&#39;t bore you. If you&#39;re in the mood to see a good Air Force movie, your choices are rather slim. Most military movies deal either with the Army, Navy or Marines. Until Hollywood can come up with an Air Force movie on the lines of `Saving Private Ryan&#39; or `A Few Good Men&#39;, we&#39;ll be forced to watch movies like the `Iron Eagle&#39; series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;
b&#39;My Take: Even splendid underwater photography can salvage a familiar script and paper-thin characters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who haven\&#39;t already got enough of the FREE WILLY pictures, FLIPPER might serve up a decent rental. Others are (heavily) suggested to stay away. Although FLIPPER is harmless affair, it hardly showcases anything for the adult audience (unless it\&#39;s your first time to see a dolphin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A remake of a 1960\&#39;s TV show and film, FLIPPER may have sound like a good idea back then: A dolphin charms the life of boy and a girl, they help ave the environment by first getting rid of toxic wastes thrown in on the sparkling waters of the Florida Keys, and at the same time, battle a shark and a salty sea baddie who happens to be the one responsible for the toxic dumping and also happens to hate dolphins. But even for the 90\&#39;s, especially if an eerily similar film like FREE WILLY was a recent hit, FLIPPER is just another harmless yet occasionally empty summer splash movie for the kids. Although the animals (this, in case, is the main dolphin, a clumsy pelican and a realistic-looking hammerhead shark, typecast as the villain) and the pristine underwater cinematography steal the show, there\&#39;s nothing much in FLIPPER to steal from anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is completely predictable, something than nowadays even a 6-year old may find evident. The (Human) cast, led by a pre-LORD OF THE RINGS Elijah Wood and an out-of-work Paul Hogan, have rarely anything to do but stand around and look pretty. Their acting skills, whatever they may be to this movie, is rarely revealed on screen, unless you consider the &#34;acting&#34; talents of cheerful Bottlenose Dolphin. I guess not trying to recommend FLIPPER as mindless family entertainment won\&#39;t be fair, but anyone over the age of 10 (No, make that 8), are better off renting or buying something else. Besides, the film is about 95 minutes tops. That might just give you enough time to something elsewhere without worrying about your kids. That alone might be worth the rental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: ** out of 5.&#39;
b&#39;As I read the script on-line, I thought &#34;Capote&#34; needed a trim. Having just seen it on PPV, I can tell you it wasn\&#39;t trimmed, it was butchered like that poor family! Example: in the script, Truman dubs Shawn &#34;Adorable One&#34;; here, he is &#34;Mr. Shawn&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad enough the amateurs behind this movie de-flame Capote and bash his circle (are we to really believe they thought so little of Nelle, they mangled her little opus like an obnoxious in-joke?), they turn Perry Smith into this oh-so-sensitive victim, even as he\&#39;s shown dispatching the Clutters. It\&#39;s one thing to fudge the facts, it\&#39;s another to drop the ball: the executions were carried out between 12:45-1:19 AM, April 14; Truman is shown at the prison 22 HOURS LATER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was totally underwhelmed by the &#34;acting&#34;. Keener doesn\&#39;t even try to sound like an Alabama native. The way Cooper kept shouting &#34;Alvin!&#34;, I was waiting for the Chimpmunks to show up! Hoffman gives us not the charming gadfly, but a pathetic suck-up who sees an horrific act as his ticket to the big time. When Hoffman whines about being &#34;tortured&#34; by the endless appeals, I wanted to give him a shotgun so he could do us both a favor and blow his brains out!&#39;
b&#34;I thought it was weird and just gory, not scary. I have seen a couple of the Japanese horror films, Ringu and Juon, and loved them; but this movie was a disappointment. It never even explained anything about the curse. I just didn&#39;t see any horror... it wasn&#39;t scary to me at all. The whole time I was watching I was waiting for Kirie to discover the secret of the curse and why it was happening now. If this was some ancient curse, why didn&#39;t it happen before Shuichi&#39;s father? And it never told us what happened to her father. I kept waiting for someone to tell us the meaning or the reasoning behind this curse and then it just ended. I was very disappointed.&#34;
b&#34;Perhaps I&#39;m just a simple person, but I prefer movies that somehow make me care about the people in them. I couldn&#39;t care less about anyone in this movie. This was supposed to be a comedy? Maybe the humor was too subtle for me (all the way down to the nano-level). The thing about it is, it missed on so many things. There were characters that could have been funny, but they weren&#39;t. There were characters that you could have liked, but you didn&#39;t. For instance, the guy who thought the Beatles ripped off his songs. There was so much potential there, but all he did was talk like a Beatle and complain about how they ripped him off. Haha. And the previous poster talked about the &#39;I am the Walrus&#39; scene like it was special. What? He played &#39;I am the Walrus&#39; on an old piano and sang out of tune. Is there an inside joke there? It sure stank at face value. This movie has the feel to me of a movie people say they like because it sounds &#39;intellectual&#39; or &#39;hip&#39; to say you like it, that you get the whole metaphysical art/garbage message the artist is expressing. If you want to be entertained, stay away.&#34;
b&#34;This sequel to Problem Child is just as bad as the first one. It still teaches kids that it&#39;s O.K. to be bad. It&#39;s impossible for me to recommend this movie to anyone.&#34;
b&#39;With Hong Kong heart-throb Andy Lau and veteran star Ching Wan Lau, &#34;Aau Chin&#34; has everything going for it for the beginning part of the movie, unfortunately, the movie falls apart at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy Lau plays a sophisticated thief who only has 4 weeks to live, but still has one thing unfinished... He pulls an elaborated scheme tricking the police into helping him... However, the police is hot on his tail.... Can he pull it off before being caught?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build up of the movie is good. Bits of pieces of clues are left behind for the audiences to try to guess at the real intention. Unfortunately, the build up leads to a disappointed final showdown. It feels as if in the middle of the script, the writer has changed and that all the build-up becomes disconnected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 3/10 ....&#39;
b&#34;Medical student Paula Henning wins a place at an exclusive Heidelberg medical school. When the body of a young man she met on the train turns up on her dissection table, she begins to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death, and uncovers a gruesome conspiracy perpetrated by an Antihippocratic secret society operating within the school. Disturbing and gross, lots of scary parts. It even has a good script and ending. But it has a one poor part. What else could you see from this movie? It&#39;s a good mystery and horror movie. But, of course, if you like it, Go buy it. If you don&#39;t, there still is not reason to waste your money on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rated R for Extreme Graphic Violence, Sexual Situations and Profanity.&#34;
b&#39;Even as a big fan of the low to no budget horror genre, I couldnt find this disaster mildly amusing. With horrible acting, a painfully generic &#34;plot&#34; and no dimensional characters, no matter how bored and drunk you are, this one is not worth your 81 minutes. Don\&#39;t make the same mistake I did. Rent something else. ANYTHING else!!!&#39;
b&#34;Don&#39;t be fooled by the other reviewers. Although this film contains an impressive array of talent, the material they present leaves a great deal to be desired. Nat King Cole&#39;s 3 numbers are pretty lame and not even close to his later efforts, though he does impress with his piano playing. &#39;Moms&#39; Mabley is not a bit funny, though I remember her as a very entertaining talk show guest from my youth. Actually, the best performances are from a couple of fat guys who impress with a lively tap dance and a Four Tops takeoff, and the jazz band itself, especially in the number featuring the bass player. The print itself is pretty poor quality, and the wonderful Butterfly McQueen is totally wasted in the wraparound plot.&#34;
b&#34;All right, let me start by saying I love the original RS for the 64. The graphics were new, the ships were really fast and cool. The missions were a challenge, but you had a strategy to come up with. The computer didn&#39;t tell you every step of your mission, you could wander and explore. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s the first thing that&#39;s wrong with RL, everything you do is under a timetable and controlled by other people. I mean, shouldn&#39;t you, as the leader, be telling people how to handle each and every mission? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And speaking of missions, why do they intersperse the original trilogy with completely made up crap? Never mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so waiting for this game when I heard they were going to allow you fly through the asteroid field from Empire Strikes Back. I think anyone who is a fan of the films wanted to do this. So, they give it to you. It&#39;s the stupidest level in the game. You start by flying through the asteroid field with ties chasing after you, and your whole objective is to get farther into the field while shooting the ties. You have to kill them all to get ahead. Hey, remember how many Han killed when he was in the field? None, they all had poor piloting skills compared to him. I just wanted to be able to dodge the asteroids as they came at me, but instead I have to use my automatic aim guns to kill ties behind me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was the biggest disappointment, you have no control over your flying, everything is sluggish. All except for the A-Wing, probably the fastest and most maneuverable ship in the entire fleet. But, oh yeah, didn&#39;t Han say the Falcon was? Anyway...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You finally get to the Battle of Endor. Here is the ultimate level, you get to destroy the death star, everyone&#39;s first instinct is to pick the Falcon and be the leader. But, of course, you get there and have to do stupid pre-chosen strategies like finding (not to mention deciphering the difference between) the tie-bombers. This is impossible in the falcon, by the time you have spotted one group the frigate gets destroyed. The only way to get passed this part is to pick the A-Wing. After this you have to attack the star destroyers and that&#39;s a real stupid chore. This game makes you feel like you&#39;re the only one defending the rebel alliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you frustratingly get through that &#39;fun&#39; fight, you get to the death star. And here, you might think &#39;yay! I get to destroy the death star&#39;, and again, like in the Asteroid field, you have to do some tedious thing while narrowly getting passed the tunnels of impending doom. Your mission is to protect the ship in front of you, remember that from the Return of the Jedi? It&#39;s so moronic because if you pick the falcon, you&#39;ll die because you&#39;re not maneuverable enough, but if you pick the x-wing, you have to keep locking and unlocking your s-foils. So it&#39;s a choice to either kill the bad guys, or try to catch up to Lando, who apparently doesn&#39;t know how to maneuver. Thus dying in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bonus stages aren&#39;t even worth aiming for as each level just gets more and more frustrating. It makes me feel the way I did when I saw the new three films, upset and in need of killing something. Lucky for me, Smash Bros Melee exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope with the Wii they come up with something a lot better and have the original trilogy levels to full capacity. I&#39;m going to sell this game the first chance I get.&#34;
b&#39;When they announced this movie for TNT I was excited. A Travesty from Donald Westlake\&#39;s &#34;Enough&#34; was one of my all time favorite stories. After I watched it I was not all that thrilled. Recently I had the chance to watch it a second time with my aunt, and once again I was disappointed (she didn\&#39;t like it much either, and she\&#39;d never read the book). In this movie they managed to sap all the charm from the book and turn it into dull mush. A big part of the problem was William H. Macy. I like him fine in other films, but he played (Terry/Carey) Thorpe as a stammering, incompetent yutz. In the book Thorpe takes a lot of valium for his nerves, but remains outwardly collected at almost all times which is part of the fun. SPOILERS follow: They also left out a big part of the story (other than a 2 second glimpse at the embassy), where Thorpe solves not 1 but 4 homicides for the police. This is important not just because it\&#39;s funny, but because it helps set up the relationship between Fred and Thorpe. In the movie Fred\&#39;s betrayal in the end is not nearly as affecting, because they don\&#39;t seem all that close. In the book they become pretty good friends especially on Fred\&#39;s side, which makes it all the more ironic that he is he one that arranges Thorpe\&#39;s downfall. Fred also suffered a bit from casting, I love Adam Arkin but he was not a cheerful, happy to be alive upbeat sort of Detective, character traits which book Fred possesses which makes it more obviously out of character for him to mess with evidence and thus more shocking. Patricia and Edgarson were pretty close to the book, and James Cromwell was great despite not looking much like Martin Balsam. The whole boring boat house scene which was entirely added for the film was much less interesting than the police finding Edgarson\&#39;s body after Thorpe ships it to Seattle and blaming the death on the mob. Kit was okay although she was mostly rewritten, and it would have been nice to see her die as she did get slightly annoying. I don\&#39;t mind changes to books to make movies, I know they are necessary because of length and difficulty, but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this movie had been funnier or smarter instead of duller.&#39;
b&#34;When I watched this movie it was an afternoon after I got home from work. I love horror movies and have seen some really cheesy ones, but this takes the cake. The plot presented to the viewer in the beginning of the movie seems a little intriguing, but as the movie progresses the script makes a wrong turn with horrible cliches and bad presentation, which in turn makes the movie completely dull and boring. I don&#39;t mean to keep criticizing the script and plot, because believe me that is not the worst part. I have to say as a whole the acting was not terrible for beginning actors, and I was impressed with Taylor Locke, this being one of his first movies. The worst part of the movie was the special effects. They reeked of low budget, and really ruined the viewers entertainment, even if he had been remotely interested in the plot. I do recommend you watch this movie to understand the power of a bad script and plot. Only then can you really appreciate good writers and directors.&#34;
b&#34;I hoped for this show to be somewhat realistic. It stroke me as just another mainstream show after I watched it. I didn&#39;t feel the characters at all, is this Americas glamorized idea of how terrorism operates? The main character doesn&#39;t act like a fundamentalist at all, and how he passes for a terrorist is beyond my comprehension. Neither of the other terrorists managed to appear genuine. One of the members, a blonde all-American white boy, would never be accepted by Muslim terrorists in real life. Another member, a french ex-skinhead, doesn&#39;t quite fit in an Islamic terror movement. On top of this the terrorists have sexual relations to white American housewives, which I find very strange. This is just another stupid misguiding American TV show. It is about just as realistic as Prison Break.&#34;
b&#34;Originally, the Spiders was planned as a four-part serial, and it shows. I dislike serials; they&#39;re typically ridiculous, convoluted and banal. This one is no exception. In the first part of the Spiders, &#39;The Golden Lake,&#39; a rich adventurer thwarts the plans of a gang of criminals--the Spiders--to steal gold from Incas. A silly love triangle ensues, with some Cowboys and Indians action. The sensationalism and exotica of it didn&#39;t entertain me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can legitimately trace themes from this two-part series to Lang&#39;s later, far superior work. And, the film-making is better than in other serials I&#39;ve seen from this time, including &#39;Les Vampires&#39; (1915). In the Spiders, the camera isn&#39;t as static, and this film is fast paced, thankfully. The tinting and lighting are adequate, too. None of that&#39;s remarkable, though. It&#39;s nearly unseemly, however, in how closely this series resembles Louis Feuillade&#39;s serials; the criminal gang dresses and behaves like those in &#39;Les Vampires&#39;--only the names, and to a lesser extent, the situations have changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the further comments on The Spiders series, see the web pages for it.&#34;
b&#34;Except for the glossy look, this show had little to recommend it. The writing was patronizing and convoluted. Without exception the characters were shallow and unsympathetic. The female characters came off the worst... reduced to spoiled, selfish airheads whose soul ambition was to run around in slip dresses and stilettos, and try to bag a man. This aspect of the show is all the more curious as the series was produced by two women! The acting for the most part was dull and humourless with the cast playing one dimensional characters attacking every scene on the same note. This is not entirely the actors fault. Had they spent more time developing the characters and the storyline, adding a little injection of style and humour, MVP might have been a hit. What we&#39;re left with is something flat and vaguely unpleasant.&#34;
b&#34;Well, you know... Rutger Hauer and Robert Patrick both are really good actors. But WTF with this movie? The story was lame and the script was just terrible. The poor actors didn&#39;t have material to work with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DVD cover invited you to a flight action flick. You would expect something like Top Gun... Huge disappointment! The flight action in this movie is so cheap that makes you puke. The aerial scenes are clearly taken from documentaries and some other footage sources, not made for this movie. And they didn&#39;t even care about the marks or the fighters models, taking for granted the audience will not notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said the story was lame. With a little effort from the writer and director it could have been very interesting. In short, it seems a B-movie made in the 70&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel very sorry for these actors who put their names here. They sure must be ashamed.&#34;
b&#34;That someone could have conceived this nonsense and then got it produced is incredible. That it actually aired on television and advertisers actually PAID TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH IT is mind boggling. This stomach-wrenching excuse for kid&#39;s programming is almost too vile to comment on. I&#39;ve burned -- yes burned -- any Barney tapes that people have given my son. To find this awful programming in my library was an unpleasant surprise. And where, tell me where, do they get those smarmy kid actors? Have their parents no sense? Those kids will be on drugs before they&#39;re teenagers. Geez. The final insult is that I have to add this extra line to the review to get it on IMDb.&#34;
b&#39;Great ensemble cast but unfortunately a bunch of undeveloped ideas make the film drag. One feels not fulfilled at the end after waiting for some kind of conclusion, closure, or at least an ironic twist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had that familiar &#34;Curb&#34; feel without dare I say it, Larry as the annoying polar opposite. The music was there, the \&#39;show about nothing\&#39; scenes pop up, but without any common thread or suspense - it falters as a solo project that ran out of budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spoilers: The movie title speaks about cheese but she prefers the rice pudding. Is cheese a better selling title than rice pudding? He prefers just any junk food, regardless of the sell by date. Maybe I want someone to eat \&#39;cheese-dogs\&#39; or ice cream in a pirate suit would have at least tied some scenes together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marty: this is just not funny and overdone. People just don\&#39;t care about a \&#39;show\&#39; within a show. A coffee book table about coffee books was funnier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you are big fans of the cast, save your time and eat some cheese. It doesn\&#39;t even have to be with anyone.&#39;
b&#34;Hadn&#39;t really heard too much about this movie so I went and saw it. I realized that this movie only appeals to someone who has not lived in the real world. And even those people would think this movie moved too slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the movie opens up, you see Nicole Kidman going to a nudist camp. Whoa. Shock. That scene, the dialouge, were all great. And then the movie went downhill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I respect the vision the filmmaker must have, this movie sucked. It was too slow, too predictable, and not moving enough. Robert Downey Jr. is great, as usual, but this movie is not good enough to sit through. It tries to be shocking and abnormal but makes poor use of the talents of all the actors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t waste your money, even the sex scenes were boring.&#34;
b&#34;My friend and I rented this movie for 3.99 at blockbuster. If I&#39;d have known how absolutely horrible this movie was going to be, I wouldn&#39;t have paid a cent. I had no warning for this bs. The acting can&#39;t even be called acting, the inevitable sex scene is awkward, and you can tell that both girls feel completely uncomfortable doing it, and the male villain... god, who couldn&#39;t tell he was going to attack emily And the musical cues... my lord. This movie makes me want to cry. Never rent this. In fact, if you happen to look upon it, gauge out your eyeballs. This movie isn&#39;t of God- it&#39;s from hell. I&#39;m just gonna take the last couple lines to write blah blah blah shiz cause I really don&#39;t want to continue on with this review.&#34;

Hello? Uh, we can hear everything you\&#39;re saying. We\&#39;re sending someone over there right now.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Embarrassment for all. Oops.&#39;
b&#34;(This review does not necessarily expose the plot of the movie, however it may change one&#39;s expectations of the movie and thus make for a less enjoyable experience.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever rented a scary movie, expecting to be on the edge of your seat in fear, and instead ended up howling in laughter at each and every stupid turn of the plot? This movie had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer. It was cut poorly and jumped around too much; making references to the past seem more like excuses as to why the plot was heading in its particular direction. The writers must not have thought about how the potentially excellent plot should have been carried out, because the poor construction of time throughout the plot is discouraging to the viewer and makes the movie increasingly tiring to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost worse than the writers having abused what could have been an excellent and classic thriller was the fact that it gradually relied on cheap tactics for a scare. The acting didn&#39;t make it scary, and the situations hardly made it scary, therefore it needed a few dark scenes with things jumping out at you to make it worthwhile. Even those were predictable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not even the gore could&#39;ve saved the plot, and it rivals the gore of the successful thriller Se7en.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of Se7en, I feel like Saw tried to follow Se7en&#39;s incredibly fascinating psychological theme, but failed miserably in doing so. I was terribly disappointed in the lack of analysis and plot structure surrounding the psychology of the killer. The beginning scenes tease the viewer into thinking that this is a psychological thriller; believe me, it is far from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, did I mention poor acting? At first, Cary Elwes seems makes a convincing performance; however, this completely deteriorates at the most crucial parts of the plot. I was left in tears of laughter at this performance, which is worthy of a Razzie. The performance of Leigh Whannell is also terrible and too played-out, although not as bad as the performance by Elwes, and the big red flag with this is that Whannell is also a writer for the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end of Saw could never make up for having lost the entire middle of it, and that is what makes it a huge failure. It was an opportunity wasted, and I have no clue as to why Monica Potter and Danny Glover chose to take roles in this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am mad at myself for wasting money on just renting it. It was definitely not worth the $4, and in the future I will definitely avoid seeing anything having to do with Elwes, Whannell or James Wan. The big tragedy in this is not that it lacked basis to its plot, it&#39;s that the great potential storyline was thrown away and poor acting added insult to injury. I&#39;ll avoid the poor puns involving the title and just conclude with this: don&#39;t watch this movie.&#34;
b&#39;I watched this movie a couple months ago when it first showed up on the shelves of Blockbuster. It is officially the only movie that I\&#39;ve wanted to undo watching. Let me start off by saying that I like &#34;B&#34; Movies. I consider &#34;Ice Pirates&#34; One of the best comedies EVER. I\&#39;ll also note that I\&#39;m a writer and that I\&#39;ve met the director/writer of this cinematic marvel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evaluating the acting: If I was going to pick a bright spot I\&#39;d have to point out that Dion Day had an admirable acting debut with his role in this. For those who don\&#39;t know, Dion is a boxer not an actor so we\&#39;ll forgive him his lame death sequence. Why doesn\&#39;t he fire the shotgun he\&#39;s holding once? Budget? To highlight the bad acting would take pages so I\&#39;ll stick to The egotistical lead, Ryn Baskin. Ryn (Which seems like a name chosen from a comic book because it sounded cool) has maximum face time in this movie, probably because he was a producer. His looks are completely fine, but his delivery evokes memories of SNL ripping on soap-operas. I suppose he could only do so much with what was written for him, but part of the blame is definitely his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special Effects: Not my specialty, but for a low-budget flick I suppose the makeup and gun play was acceptable. It didn\&#39;t bother me, but it also didn\&#39;t impress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing/Directing: Oscar for best screenplay is not something I can foresee Gerald Nott ever winning. Not only is the plot rudimentary, but the dialog is flat and stilted. I understand stylized hokee-ness, but this was just bad writing. The thing that bothered me most was the theft. Nott stole scenes, shots, and Viggo\&#39;s facial hair from a slew of other movies. The scene where Russel Crow is walking through the wheat field in Gladiator, Entire sequences from The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, that sort of thing just doesn\&#39;t cut it with me. I\&#39;ll choose not to comment on the shooting because I don\&#39;t know what it takes to establish a good shot etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Don\&#39;t rent this movie, don\&#39;t even pirate it. It\&#39;s far too bad to waste any time on. The good reviews may be entirely bogus, after meeting Gerry It seems more then likely that he is posting them himself.&#39;
b&#34;If you haven&#39;t read Tolkien&#39;s masterpiece; prepare yourself for maybe the best movie experience ever! If you have however... After having read the books several times, over many years, I have come to love the characters and story, and feel I Know it intimately. I have my own personal vision of The Shire, Hobbiton and the character-gallery. Thus for me the movie was a disappointment. Why? It dictates the appearance of the characters (unavoidably), it changes events, it removes important storyline, it removes not-so-important storyline. Great chunks of what makes The Lord Of The Rings what it is, is simply ignored. Even 2001 special effects can&#39;t do Tolkien&#39;s (and your own) imagination justice. Peter Jackson has made an honest attempt at the impossible, and I don&#39;t think anyone else could have done it better! But the fact remains, I regret seeing the movie. The next time I read The Lord Of The Rings, Peter Jackson&#39;s limited vision will leap forward, not my own.&#34;
b&#34;Badly shot, badly edited, clumsy dialogue, flat characters, unsuccessful adaption of a novel. It doesn&#39;t really get much worse. Decent acting and good popcorn saved me for this hour and a half - felt more like three hours - of boredom. Occasional good one-liners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David is a dim-witted young man, who has never recovered from losing his brother at an early age. He puts his faith in a Chinese philosophy mumbo jumbo video, although that doesn&#39;t seem to help him much in real life. David is a member of a debt-collectors gang, where every member has an IQ below sea level. A lacking script, along with uncreative shooting and even worse editing, make what could have been quite funny incidents of failed debt-collecting look like a amateurish homemade reality show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David rents an apartment from an elementary school teacher, Haraldur, who by dropping a couple of sentences about his own importance convinces David he is dealing with the most dangerous criminal in Iceland. A severely lacking script doesn&#39;t offer David anything to base his opinion on. A couple of scenes SHOWING Haraldur doing something that David could have misinterpreted would have done the work. The potentials of film as media, as opposed to the text of the book this film is based on, are not exploited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, David&#39;s connection with Haraldur raises his status within the debt-collectors gang, but the prevailing paranoia in the criminal world forces David to show where his loyalty lies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot of the film is fine, but then it is based on the book. This could have been a much better film. A good screenwriter could have made something of this material. Sadly, that is not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is generally good. P\xc3\xa9tur J\xc3\xb3hann is excellent and credible as David. Eggert \xc3\x9eorleifsson doesn&#39;t get much to work with, but does his best with what little material he has. Ingvar Sigur\xc3\xb0sson and Michael Imperioli (in a tiny role) manage alright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall opinion: What could have been quite a funny and entertaining film about a dim-witted anti-hero in a debt-collectors gang, becomes a boring, badly-crafted film made after a poor manuscript. Staring at your toes for an hour and a half would be more enjoyable.&#34;
b&#39;By the standards of Hollywood this movie was filmed and edited as Hollywood movies are and therefore looked like a movie you would get out of a big-time production studio within Hollywood. Thats where anything remotely close to having Hollywood standards ends. This was THE WORST MOVIE I have EVER seen in MY LIFE! I am not joking. The story was so unbelievably stupid and unrealistic that I could not contain my laughter in the movie theater through the course of watching this film. I know what you\&#39;re saying, &#34;its a horror film its not supposed to have a good story it\&#39;s supposed to scare you.&#34; Well let me tell you something, the movie is not even scary in the least bit. Its too full of stupid bits that cancels out the little suspense there may have been. The acting was awful as well, along with the scariness of the murderer, who you constantly see through flashbacks locked in a cage jacking off. Throughout the movie I kept getting a sense I was watching something that was thought up, written, produced, and directed by a high-schooler who watches too much pornography. Please, don\&#39;t see this movie, spend your $8.50 on other things, like a snow cone, which would be much more worth your while.&#39;
b&#34;Rarely seen a movie that deviates so much from the original premise and still remains (more or less) acceptable\xc2\x85Bloodline is a rather short (which is a good thing in this case) escapade that focuses on the mysterious Hellraiser box. Who wanted it to be made and how it cast a spell on the entire bloodline of the man who eventually created it. We&#39;re introduced to 3 generations of the Merchant family (all played by Bruce Ramsey); one in 18th century Paris, one in the present day and the last one in a future galaxy far, far away\xc2\x85 Opinions on this storyline may differ a lot\xc2\x85either you think it&#39;s very idiotic and far-fetched or\xc2\x85original and dared. The initial atmosphere and setting by Clive Barker has completely vanished, yet the morbid surrounding remains and several sequences are still very creepy and unsettling. Hellraiser: Bloodline contains quite a lot of exquisite slaughtering and the charismatic presence of Pinhead (Doug Bradley) still is an extra horror-value. Pinhead \xc2\x96 accompanied by a pet puppy this time \xc2\x96 still knows how to kill\xc2\x85too bad he talks too much and his vicious speeches tend to get boring quickly. Best aspects in this production are the newly introduced `cenobites&#39; and the occult Parisian portrait. Giant turn-offs are the weak script, the absence of the typical macabre humor and the lack of references to Barker&#39;s initial masterpiece. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although not highly memorable itself, Bloodline stands as the last watchable Hellraiser film. After this sequel, the series went downhill completely. So far, 2 more sequels came out (2 more are still in process) and neither of those is worth seeing. Hellraiser:Bloodline suffered from a lot of production difficulties and the director eventually preferred to be credited as Alan Smithee\xc2\x85Meaning he doesn&#39;t want to be remembered as the director of it. Who could blame him?&#34;
b&#39;Terrible adaptation of Heminway\&#39;s low key love story. An American soldier (Rock Hudson) falls in love with a British nurse (Jennifer Jones) in Italy during World War 1. What\&#39;s wrong with this? Virtually everything. Hudson is WAY out of his depth here. He could be a good actor but not in this movie. Jones is far too old for her role (she\&#39;s 21 in the book--here she\&#39;s 38...and looks it!). Also her acting wavered between overdone and underdone! They took a simple low-key love story and blew it all out of proportion. The film is fatally long (a little over 150 minutes), self-indulgent and padded to a ridiculous degree. It seems producer David O. Selznick thought he was doing &#34;Gone With the Wind&#34; again. Some of the scenery is truly stunning (even on a small TV screen) but there\&#39;s not enough of a story to match the images. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPOILER!!! The ending where Jones dies is supposed to be tragic but the bad acting and overblown theatrics had me fighting not to laugh! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse actor Vittorio De Sica overacts to a truly embarrassing degree. Overblown, self-indulgent, badly cast and slow. Pretty terrible. This was (understandably) a financial and critical bomb and ended Selznick\&#39;s career as a producer. You might want to tune in for some of the scenery at the end but it\&#39;s really not worth it. I give this a 3.&#39;
b&#34;**Possible Spoilers**\tFrom Dreamworks and director Peter Chan, `The Love Letter&#39; is a romantic comedy that takes place in a picturesque, New England coastal village where single mom Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a quaint, little bookstore. One day at work, Helen happens across an anonymous letter (the `love letter&#39; of the title) that has somehow become lodged beneath the cushions of a reading couch. Upon reading the amorous prose therein, she believes it has been written to her, purposely placed in the couch for her to find, and, for reasons of her own, thinks she knows the identity of her secret admirer. Inadvertently, however, Helen leaves the letter out where her employee, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres) finds it, believes it to be for her, and, of course, thinks she knows who wrote it. Circumstances then bring it into the possession of a young man named Johnny (Tom Everett Scott), who thinks Helen has written the letter to him. And before it all gets sorted out, you can only imagine the hilarious situations into which all of those involved have been cast; and I do mean imagine, because the way this movie plays out, the audience gets little more from it than what it brings along itself. There are two specific areas in which this romantic comedy fails miserably: It simply isn&#39;t very romantic, and it&#39;s not funny; and that is a potent combination that causes this film to misfire practically from the opening credits. Once the setting and main character (Helen) have been established, it basically goes nowhere for the next ninety minutes or so. By the time you finally find out who actually wrote the letter, and to whom, you could care less. Rounding out the cast is Tom Selleck, Blythe Danner, Julianne Nicholson, Gloria Stuart and Geraldine McEwan. It&#39;s a shame to see such talent wasted on such claptrap as this, and looking bad in the balance. Kate Capshaw, who usually brightens up the screen just by showing up, looks tired here, while Selleck appears to have just come in off a three day bender that&#39;s lasted a week. Ellen DeGeneres actually comes away looking the best of the bunch. It is said that the journey is often a more heady experience than the destination. In the case of `The Love Letter,&#39; however, it would have been best for all concerned if everybody had just stayed home in the first place. I rate this one 1/10.&#34;
b&#34;A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clich\xc3\xa9s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo. Even the squibs look awful. At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America. Three wonky old cars do not a country make.The Mustang even has a wobbly right front wheel. The plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing. It couldn&#39;t come soon enough. Even the jewellery from the robbery looks like the cheapest junk costume jewellery available. The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time. Worth watching if you want to know how not to make a clich\xc3\xa9-ridden low budget movie.&#34;
b&#39;Look, this film is terrible... the &#34;plot&#34; involves twins who are neglected by their self-absorbed parents, and left in the care of a succession of nannies and babysitters, all of whom the children drive away by being completely obnoxious. Eventually the kids engineer ex-convict Beverly D\&#39;Angelo to be their new nanny, do you care why? And D\&#39;Angelo watches a TV talk show about selling children and decides she will try to sell the twins... and, well, oh, you don\&#39;t want to know. It\&#39;s all very unpleasant, and not at all funny. In fact the announcer slated this film before it came on the TV channel I was watching! Just don\&#39;t bother wasting a single moment of your life on this pile of complete trash, y\&#39;hear?&#39;
b&#34;I loved All Dogs go to Heaven so much that I went to see the sequel in the theater, and I can&#39;t remember being more disappointed by a movie. The story stank worse than an over-aged sack of manure. I mean, come on! How could Carface possibly imagine being able to get revenge on an animal so much bigger than him, no matter how angry he was. Plus depicting Satan as a CAT?!?! How clich\xc3\xa9 can you get? So much for the story. Is it any wonder that Don Bluth, Burt Reynolds, Melba Moore, and Vic Tayback wouldn&#39;t touch it with a 10 foot pole? The animation was absolutely wretched. The colors were all washed out, and I can&#39;t count how many times I was able to see through objects that were supposed to be solid. It had to be the worst animation I&#39;ve ever seen! I usually like animated movies, but not this BOMB!&#34;
b&#39;I figure this to be an &#34;alternate reality&#34; teen flick...More precisely a Ferris Bueller type character as the leader of a cheat ring . Yeah, I know it\&#39;s not meant to compared to Ferris Bueller, at least not in a &#34;oranges-to-oranges&#34; way, but it will none-the-less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom-line: It\&#39;s galaxies away from even being even a minor classic. It is watchable, though only if you\&#39;re not expecting very much. That said, the main character has some charm, but the premise wears thin because the writing just isn\&#39;t clever. The movie just did not deliver enough laughs, twists, or tension to keep my interest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest I did continue watching...Watching with hopes to see if anything suddenly clicked. It didn\&#39;t. So, stylish as it is, I wouldn\&#39;t recommend this movie. BTW, it seems odd to see Mary Tyler Moore as the principal. She\&#39;s truly miscast, I hope the paycheck was inordinately big.&#39;
b&#39;Begotten is, no doubt, someone\&#39;s attempt at originality, but, what we have here is art in its most morbid, grotesque form, so, for that, Begotten has my respect, but, to be realistic, it makes no difference what this abomination is about, but for the record...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the ultimate in incoherent horror, we begin in an unknown time, in an unknown place. Right off the bat, we are plunged into the psychotic nightmare that is Begotten, a god is, seemingly depressed, mutilating himself with a razor, I mean, really trying like hell to end it all, it takes a while (why wouldn\&#39;t it?) After this ultra-morbid introduction, something is happening, something is rising from the corpse, say hello to Mother Earth. What does she do? Well, she gives birth to a thing. The thing would have probably preferred to stay in the womb, but that\&#39;s life. The psychotic nightmare realm of Begotten welcomes the thing the only way it knows how. The thing, along with Mother Earth is mutilated by unknown, hooded, assailants, with evil intentions being the only clarity available. From this point on, things drag as they\&#39;ve never dragged before. Interesting, grim images, with a totally decent soundtrack, is the high points of the remainder. Not to give the impression that I don\&#39;t recommend this evilness, because I do, but only once, and only for people with an appreciation for the dark side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my description, it may appear that I don\&#39;t &#34;get&#34; Begotten. Trust me, I get it, and yes, Begotten is art if I\&#39;ve ever seen it. Everything in this film, regardless of how unrelated it may seem, is significant. That, perhaps, is the only thing that makes Begotten art. With that said, most of us require some form of entertainment value, and this is coming from someone who enjoyed The Chooper. Probably the most intriguing first five minutes, I\&#39;ve seen in a film, but let\&#39;s be realistic, the next 7 hours and 55 minutes would put one in a coma, that is, unless it\&#39;s just meant for some kind of psychedelic purposes, in that case, never mind. But, how would one rate such a uniquely boring masterpiece? Depending on how much your attention span can take, It should be either 1 or 10, any other number just wouldn\&#39;t make a statement. It hurts to do this, but as far as entertainment value goes, Begotten just ain\&#39;t it. 1/1&#39;
b&#34;I like Steven Seagal but I have not a CLUE what this movie was about. I am not easily lost with movies but I had no idea who was on who&#39;s side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully some of his future movies will be a little better. My wife still thinks he looks good in black jeans, however. :P&#34;
b&#39;The word &#34;boring&#34; gets thrown around way too often when referring to exactly how bad a low-budget Horror movie might, or might not be. I\&#39;ve seen many a B-movie. Many horrible, terribly inept B-movies. Some with a production value of a few hundred bucks. Does ineptness, lousy acting, worse continuity, and embarrassing budgets really make a movie unwatchable? Some would no doubt way yes. Most of which are probably huge fans of The Matrix. Well, I hate big-budget movies, so I say no. Bad can sometimes be funny (Blood Freak), sometimes even mind-blowing (Troll 2), but Boring will always be unwatchable... Hey, kinda like Bloodthirsty Butchers, which reminds me, I\&#39;m writing a review for this pile of garbage... Uh, yeah, anyway. This is one of late British director Andy Milligan\&#39;s many alternatives to sleeping pills. This one is based on Sweeney Todd... Great. Milligan takes a boring story, and still manages to &#34;butcher&#34; it. Hey, that\&#39;s pretty funny, I said bu... sorry, I keep getting distracted. This isn\&#39;t exactly easy. On second thought, I\&#39;ll make it easy. No gore, no scares, no entertainment, just unlikeable, annoying people having incoherent conversations. that\&#39;s Bloodthirsty Butchers. Oh yeah, and something about a barber killing people, and something or other about meat pies. I don\&#39;t know, it\&#39;s not important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For something a little more rewarding from Andy Milligan, there\&#39;s always the only other one I\&#39;ve seen, The Rats Are Coming, The Werewolves Are Here. Yeah, you heard me. But hows about we forget about this Milligan guy all together, and pick up something sweet like Sick Girl or Teenape Goes To Camp. Whatever you decide, just know, Bloodthirsty Butchers sucks, possibly even more than any other version of this already lackluster tale. And that, B-movie fans, is really saying something. 2/10&#39;
b&#39;Do not watch this movie, or.. If you are really mad at anyone, you can give this as a birthdaypresent. This is the worst movies I have ever seen. Do NOT watch this. If you do, remember: That would be a self-destructive action. It is a shame that this is not voted lower.&#39;
b&#34;Pointless movie about making a movie. No where near the flesh shown in the original, which was quite enjoyable and even had fun music. Not here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s always fun seeing the Pathmark guy though.&#34;
b&#39;I was so disappointed in this movie. I am very familiar with the case, having read not only Mark Fuhrman\&#39;s book but also the far superior &#34;A Wealth of Evil: The True Story of the Murder of Martha Moxley in America\&#39;s Richest Community&#34; by Timothy Dumas. Anyone who watches MURDER IN GREENWICH should be aware they\&#39;re watching The Mark Fuhrman story, not the Martha Moxley story. This film is nothing more than an ego-trip for Fuhrman. Just watch his character strut around as if he is the second coming (yes, even being ogled by women). The actors playing the kids look way too old for their roles and the flashbacks to the 1970s are totally unconvincing. If there is any hero to this story, it\&#39;s Martha\&#39;s family, her mother Dorothy and brother John. They kept this case alive for two decades before Fuhrman walked into it in order to make a name for himself. They, and Martha, deserve to have the true story told.&#39;
b&#34;This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Unless you&#39;re into masochism, never see it. It was an insufferably long, pointless, eye-harming, depressing movie and will forever top my list of bad movies. Whoever wrote this movie is a sadist. I almost cried at the end, that&#39;s how bad it was. I&#39;d like to give it zero stars, but since that&#39;s not an option, I give it one.&#34;
b&#39;Everything that made the original so much fun seems to absent here. This is simply a &#34;run of the mill demons on the loose wrecking havoc&#34; slasher, but without the passion that graced the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There\&#39;s nothing new in the story, in fact it seems like they ignore the first one altogether. Here, the demons run loose in a high security apartment building and, naturally, kill most of the residents in grisly fashion. The makeup effects actually seem less convincing here than the first time around. Although the actors weren\&#39;t exactly brilliant in Demons, in Demons 2 they\&#39;re actually a lot worse. You don\&#39;t care about these characters, AT ALL. The plot is nonexistent, the music poor (apart from one Simon Boswell song), it\&#39;s not scary in the least; it\&#39;s just not that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easily the worst film Dario Argento has been involved with and Lamberto Bava\&#39;s also (Bava has a cameo in this film, not a very funny one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe 3 is too high a rating, but at least I could watch it all and didn\&#39;t think of stopping midway. My advice; Stick to the original.&#39;
b&#34;There&#39;s nothing to say except I want my time back that this movie took from me. I&#39;m not racist against Latinos. Hell, I&#39;m half Brazilian. I loved the movie Kids. It doesn&#39;t make any sense. These kids just go around and do nothing. They&#39;re not even good at skating. The whole time I&#39;m just waiting for something, anything, to happen! but it doesn&#39;t. NOTHING happens the whole movie. Did I mention they suck at skating. I might make a movie called beat up rockers, and the whole premise will be about kicking the sh*t out of poser moron punks like these kids. I&#39;m not even going to get into it, this movie sucks. Please do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you come in contact with it so some other poor soul won&#39;t make the same mistake.&#34;
b&#39;Opening with some blatantly reused footage from \&#39;Kit for Cat\&#39;, \&#39;Tweety\&#39;s S.O.S\&#39; fails to live up to that classic cartoon. Instead, we get an example of Friz Freleng\&#39;s Tweety and Sylvester series at its most generic. Unlike Chuck Jones\&#39;s Road Runner series, which strived to introduce new jokes to the same setting, Freleng\&#39;s series seemed happy enough to recycle jokes as long as the characters were in a different place. \&#39;Tweety\&#39;s S.O.S\&#39;, then, basically amounts to &#34;this time let\&#39;s put \&#39;em on a boat&#34;. It\&#39;s not an entirely weak cartoon. There are a few good jokes, mostly involving Granny\&#39;s glasses, but they are outweighed by gags you can see coming a mile off (the seasickness routine) and it all builds to another of those endings where someone else other than Tweety says &#34;I tawt I taw a putty tat&#34;, a joke that worked well once but has diminishing returns. \&#39;Tweety\&#39;s S.O.S\&#39; will probably please children who enjoy virtually any cartoon but for big kids like me who are looking for more than the same tired gags it\&#39;s definitely one to avoid.&#39;
b&#34;Just finished watching 2FTM. The trailers intrigued me so much I actually went to see it on opening weekend, something I never do. Needless to say I was very disappointed. The story has so much potential and it&#39;s frustrating to see it get screwed up. I really feel the problem with the movie was the directing and Matthew McConaughey. First off I am not a MM hater, I thought he was awesome in both Reign of Fire and Lone Star. I enjoyed his performance in those movies without having to see him with his shirt off 3-4 times. Yes we all get it that he a good-looking guy with a nice body, but I think most people knew this 10 years ago when he came on the scene in A Time to Kill. Showing him with his shirt off pumping iron like a sweaty madman 3-4 times in the movie is totally unnecessary. I think one time would have been sufficient. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if they threw those unnecessary scenes in so girlfriends and wives would be willing to tag along with their significant other, no woman wants to see a movie about sports gambling, unless......Enough about that, let&#39;s get into his role. I feel his acting was very forced and he didn&#39;t seem very comfortable. I know his character was supposed to be this charming southerner, but his lines were corny and cheesy. It was almost like he was referencing Days and Confused lines a few times! In short, I didn&#39;t like his character even though I was supposed to. The accent, his shirt off, corny pick up lines, weak sales pitches. His character was just too much of a tool, as Brandon or Jonathan. Pacino and Assante were great, but that&#39; no surprise. Piven is fun to watch as Arie....oooops I mean Jerry. I just feel this movie was very commercial and put together poorly. It&#39;s insulting that they could take a great story, and throw in crap ingredients to try and make it a box office success. 1. Cool story that appeals to the male man 2. Hunky Hollywood actor for female women (make sure he has numerous scenes with shirt off lifting weights) 3. Al Pacino with 4 great speech scenes, and 25 great one liners 3. Every character shall be dressed in thousand dollars suites and have an extremely dark tan 4. Jeremy Piven to play the same character he did in Entourage and Old School 4. Throw in Armand Assante to seal the deal 5. Plot, good writing, character development, and intelligent casting are unnecessary&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be good enough for most people, but not me! Anybody who disagrees with me, ask your self this. Would this movie be much better if: A. Directed by Sodeberg B. DeCaprio or Ed Norton as Brandon instead of MM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably be part of the minority in thinking this movie sucks. I realized this when the woman next to me started crying during the ridiculous ending scene of Pacino shedding a fake tear while embracing Russo. The financial success of this movie will ensure one thing. The movie going public gets what the movie going public wants, big budget crapola.&#34;
b&#39;I nearly fell asleep during a screening of this. Of a boring story that seems to go on forever, it follows several days in the life of a male prostitute who falls in love with one of his tricks. After a heated affair, the trick leaves a long letter explaining why they cannot be together and how they must go on their separate ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The male prostitute then goes on a downward self-destructive spiral trying to find his &#34;one true love&#34;, repeatedly returning to the same places they frequented, looking for more clues or signs as to where he may locate his love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meanwhile, he hooks up with one ugly guy (who I thought was also a male prostitute), a gay basher, and some guy who ends up having a &#34;three-second sexual intercourse session&#34; with him in a back alley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It never ceases to amaze me how films STILL portray random sex acts as scenes that can take place in a brief matter of seconds, such as in this case where the trick barely has his pants unbuckled before thrusting three times and miraculously experiencing orgasm! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these random encounters end with the sexual partner asking him to call them, to which he discards their telephone numbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a brief side-plot involving the main character visiting his busy mother who seems to have no time for his lifestyle. There is also another brief side-plot involving some random conversation with a young woman who has noticed him several times standing on the bridge from her window. And there is also one more brief side-plot involving him showing the letter to a male acquaintance, but the audience is not advised of his relation to this person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of these things really connect with each other, only to show us how lost and confused this young man really is. He seems to be living life like a ghost. There was one good scene in the entire movie that involved him rummaging through a yard sale looking for a particular record with the world\&#39;s saddest song on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this movie just seems to go on forever. Filmed in black and white, it may seem very dreamlike, but sitting in the theater for nearly two hours watching this drivel will resemble something more like a nightmare!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the ending to be confusing as I wasn\&#39;t quite sure whether the young man had died and gone to heaven? That would have been a nice pay off to end the misery that both audience and the main character had to endure in this meaningless tripe. But seeing as this is an &#34;independent film&#34;, movies with endings like these are supposed to encourage you to &#34;use your imagination&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who are seeking out nudity, there are only brief scenes and most of them are filmed in such a way that anything suggestive are artfully concealed within the shadows. In other words, don\&#39;t waste your time with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Rating - 2 out of 10&#39;
b&#39;Before we start, may I say I hope you\&#39;ve already eaten when you\&#39;re reading this. Why? Because, after I\&#39;d seen this film for the first time, the bird\&#39;s look and sound made me want to eat chicken after the words \&#39;The End\&#39; had appeared on the screen. So don\&#39;t say you weren\&#39;t warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fred Sears might have directed &#34;Earth vs. the Flying Saucers&#34; (an okay film and one of the bigger examples for Tim Burton\&#39;s &#34;Mars Attacks&#34;), but &#34;The Giant Claw&#34; is not that giant a film. Yes, it\&#39;s a prehistoric monster that flies in the air, attacks planes and cities and occasionally treats itself to a man on a parachute. The beast is giant except in the scenes where it\&#39;s considerably smaller, but who needs consistent proportions in a movie? Scary? It could have been, but not if the plot is hopelessly silly and the monster looks like like a puppet that ran away from Sesame Street.&#39;
b&#39;This film tries to skewer the studio era in Hollywood and the morals of the 1950s. Guy Stone is intended to be a Rock Hudson type, but both the script and actor Matt Letscher end up channeling a smarmy, cruel, baritone-voiced version of George Hamilton instead, which makes for an unpleasant character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guy Stone is such a reprehensible human being that the audience has trouble liking this waste of human skin. Unlike Hudson, who was sweetly promiscuous, Stone is a hateful person who knowingly uses and then throws away the sweet, handsome young men who share his bed every few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Veronica Cartwright is Jerry, Stone\&#39;s celibate lesbian manager. Cartwright is very good, but the director doesn\&#39;t quite know what to do with her. The fault lies in the dialogue, which is a bit clumsy, and the film suffers for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carrie Preston\&#39;s Sally owes more to Ellen Greene in &#34;The Little Shop of Horrors&#34;. As written, Preston\&#39;s Sally is good for a laugh but little else. Newcomer Adam Greer is lost in this movie. He cannot act, and seems to have been cast for his hot body and good looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many recent films, &#34;Straight-Jacket&#34; is a &#34;dramedy&#34; -- a comedy film which switches messily to a drama about two-thirds of the way through the film. And, like almost all dramedies, &#34;Straight-Jacket&#34; fails miserably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the expensive services of Skywalker Sound, the sound quality of the film leaves a lot of be desired. The over-use of the musical soundtrack creates a distracting amount of cues as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film really doesn\&#39;t managed to satirize anything about the 1950s. Unlike &#34;Singin\&#39; in the Rain,&#34; which perfectly captures Hollywood\&#39;s ambivalence about the advent of sound as well as the studio mentality about formula films, &#34;Straight-Jacket&#34; doesn\&#39;t manage to depict Hollywood in the 1950s at all well. The dialogue, sets and behavior of the key characters are nondescript rather than dead-on stereotypes of the 1950s Hollywood. The same can be said for the lampooning of the general mores, social trends and fads of the 1950s as a whole. Compare the transformation of Guy\&#39;s home to the dead-on satire of the 1950s home in &#34;Little Shop of Horrors&#34;. There is no comparison; &#34;Little Shop&#34; hits the nail on the head, while &#34;Straight-Jacket&#34; doesn\&#39;t even know there is a nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Motivations, too, seem haphazard. Rick Foster is supposed to be a principled liberal, yet he falls almost immediately for a materialistic schmuck like Guy Stone. Rick is fine with Guy\&#39;s closeted status for many months. But when it comes time to go to Italy, he becomes conflicted for reasons that are completely unclear. And even though Sally appears to fall in love with Freddie during the party, this plot point simply disappears a few minutes later without comment. Rick comes off like a gay man from the 1990s, not a gay author of the 1950s. Indeed, modern morality suffuses this film -- which it shouldn\&#39;t, if it were really a satirical look at homophobia in 1950s Hollywood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot holes in this ragtag film also abound. Saul repeatedly says that he\&#39;s going to turn Freddie Stevens over to the feds, but never does so -- allowing Freddie to out Guy. Jerry and Saul\&#39;s plot to &#34;in&#34; Guy never makes any sense, nor does Sally\&#39;s sudden decision to take the blame. And although Guy has admitted he is a homosexual, apparently it doesn\&#39;t matter and he ends up a famous star and playwright anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, none of the production values manage to save this film. The cinematography by Michael Pinkey is pedestrian. At times, the film almost looks like a filmed play rather than a motion picture (especially the scenes in Saul\&#39;s office). Everything is restricted to medium shots, and the film has an incredibly static. The editing by Chris Conlee doesn\&#39;t do the film any help, either. Long scenes which would benefit from the insertion of close-ups or shifts in point of view remain uncut. Whether this is due to lack of coverage or bad editing is not clear, but the overall effect is to create a sense of lethargy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film relies heavily on CGI effects of Guy\&#39;s home, created by visual effect designer Thomas Dickens. But the CGI looks clumsy and hokey, and it is very noticeably amateurish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall impression of this film is that the jokes are cheap and easy, the plot muddled, the characterizations wildly inconsistent and way off the mark, the satire nonexistent, the performances overbroad and off the mark, and the comic timing off. It\&#39;s almost an amateurish film. It is as if someone took a high school production and threw $10 million at it.&#39;
b&#39;I think Homegrown is a bit of a misnomer for this movie - more like &#34;Plantation Grown&#34; - but it doesn\&#39;t have quite the same ring to it. My guide described it a comedy, but the pathetic travails of these hapless buffoons is not my idea of a belly laugh. More in the genre of the farcical thriller/drama. The characters developed well enough - an all-star cast made it oh-so promising, just a shame the plot was patently absurd. Ted Danson provided a fine cameo as did Jamie Lee Curtis in her walk-on part. Jon Bon Jovi has this amazing ability to measure THC content in the front seat of his car! I guess if you imbibe a few beforehand you should be able to sit through this one - not for the gun shy paranoid types though.&#39;
b&#34;I started to take a critical view on this adaptation within the first few minutes but as a dedicated Jane Austen fan I persevered through to the end... However, this is not a programme I would recommend to someone unfamiliar with her work as I don&#39;t think it does the book justice, nor makes particularly entertaining television in its own right. There was something about this adaptation that lacked believability - many of the costumes and even the actors did not have an authentic look and I found the acting to be, at times, poor. There is no doubt that the actors were all very good-looking, but this didn&#39;t provide enough variety to create really diverse, memorable characters. It was far too static being set entirely in the same location and missing out Fanny&#39;s return home, which is one of the most interesting parts of the story. The best actor was Blake Ritson, who captured the wholesomeness of Edmund very well, and the Crawfords were effectively cast too. I do like Billie Piper as an actress, but this role did not suit her and was much better played by Frances O&#39;Connor in the 1999 version who gave overall a far more subtle and convincing performance. Jane Austen adaptations will always provide a love story to leave you feeling good but unfortunately, this is one of the worst I have seen.&#34;
b&#34;I have to say this is better than most SyFy outings, but that isn&#39;t saying much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot is that someone buys a game that is made from the bones and skin of a dead witch from the Spanish Inquisition (and nobody ever expects the Spanish Inquisition!) He and his friends play the game, only to be interrupted halfway through when the friend who went on the beer run is killed in a way that the game predicted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What then follows are a series of kills that are typical for a movie like this, or any of the Final Destination movies. It has the puzzle at the end and the interesting subplot with the cop who wants the game to bring back his family... but otherwise, it&#39;s just a mess.&#34;
b&#39;An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I\&#39;d love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!). The soundtrack wasn\&#39;t terrible, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable. Still, it was the SETS that got a big &#34;10&#34; on my &#34;oy-vey&#34; scale. I don\&#39;t know where this was filmed, but were I to hazard a guess, it would be either an open-air museum, or one of those re-enactment villages, where everything is just a bit too well-kept to do more than suggest the &#34;real Old West&#34;. Okay, so it was shot on a college kid\&#39;s budget. That said, I could have forgiven one or two of the aforementioned faults. But taken all together, and being generous, I could not see giving it more than three stars.&#39;
b&#39;This film is unbelievable on any level. It fails as an action film because no one would be fooled for a moment that the props, actors and scenery are realistic. It fails because even the most gung-ho would see through the hollow chauvinism portrayed by the film, a hypocritical might is right mentality.&#39;
b&#34;Possibly the worst film within the genre in existence. It was announced as a comedy, but is simply tragically pathetic. I don&#39;t think anyone could have achieved anything more terrible and irritating if they were specifically requested to. It is toilet humour at its very poorest, I would avoid even watching the trailer. I only went to see it because it was announced that if you like Monty Python, you are bound to love this. Whoever wrote that was either biased or seriously deranged. I am still bewildered how one can honestly believe such a statement. Rarely do I leave the cinema, really it takes a lot of effort for a film to have that effect on me: this one did it in just 30 minutes.&#34;
b&#34;I love cheesy horror movies, I think dead alive and bad taste are great and I think slumber party massacre II (not even related to this movie) are hilarious. But this movie absolutely stank, I didn&#39;t laugh, I didn&#39;t even enjoy it.. you can see all kinds of mistakes that aren&#39;t even campy. The best take of the scene where the woman leans out the window is the one where she smacks her head on the sill? Give me a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t rent this thinking it&#39;s related to the slumber party massacre series. It&#39;s awful and I don&#39;t even have a clue how it got any distribution. Rent it with a fake name and burn it, do everyone else the favor.&#34;
b&#39;I just finished reading Forsyth\&#39;s novel \&#39;Icon\&#39;. I thought it was one of the most in depth, detailed, and page-turning books I ever read, definitely in my top 10. I acquired a DVD version of the book starring Mr. Swayze. OK, let me first point out that to fit a decent adaptation of the novel into 2.5 hours film time would of been impossible, so I understand the teams reason to sway from the book version and differ. However, when I say &#34;differ&#34; what I really should say is &#34;take the characters from the book, add a few, leave a few out, take away the book\&#39;s plot, add a modern new plot, add Frederick Forsyth\&#39;s name in there somewhere&#34;. Im not saying this was a bad picture, far from it, some of the effects were top notch and the acting wasn\&#39;t half bad. The story sucked and didn\&#39;t rely on logic or reality. Forsyth\&#39;s novel was so good and real and altered the facts of reality instead of exaggerating them.. This could of been so much more if it had taken its time and been made into say a 10 part series. If you haven\&#39;t read the book then expect a decent TV movie with a good acting cast, if you have read the book then try and forget it when watching this.&#39;
b&#34;It may be, although there are still two or three I&#39;ve missed. This film constructs an interesting nocturnal cityscape, reminiscent of so many foggy scenes from Sherlock Holmes movies, and populates it with sinister, Kafka-esque characters. Into their midst, the movie drops Mia Farrow, who sounds like she&#39;s still playing Hannah, and Woody Allen, who seems to be reprising his nebbish role from Play It Again Sam. Are we supposed to laugh at his stammering and hand-wringing? I suppose I would, if the rest of the movie were clearly a comedy, but it&#39;s not. At least I don&#39;t think it is.&#34;
b&#39;Dark Harvest is a very low budget production made by a bunch of rank amateurs which manages to come off as a kind of semi-professional movie. Unfortunately the poor effects, wooden acting and unoriginal story makes this a very mediocre horror slasher at best. By no means is Dark Harvest the worst horror movie i\&#39;ve ever seen, it just isn\&#39;t anything special and has nothing in it to warrant a second watch or hope for a sequel. You know a director has doubts about their own horror film when a) there is some pointless nudity and b) the movie\&#39;s so short they add some rather boring outtakes at the end credits that nobody really cares about because the movie wasn\&#39;t that good! A slightly better movie which i can\&#39;t help feeling was the inspiration for Dark Harvest is the eighties movie \&#39;Scarecrows\&#39; which is an OK movie but still pretty average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark Harvest isn\&#39;t as bad as some of the other comments say it is but don\&#39;t think that you will be entertained much either. One thing i also have to comment on is the character of Angela who has a really terrible English accent! What was the point in that?! To maybe give it a certain touch of class? Yeah right! English people do NOT say &#34;WAAHTAAH&#34; when they mean to say &#34;water&#34; and i don\&#39;t care what part of England they are from! If you can\&#39;t find a genuine English actress or a non-English actress who can put on a brilliant English accent (not many of them about) then DON\&#39;T BOTHER! Sheesh! Final score: 4/10&#39;
b&#39;I\&#39;m a huge lover of really bad B movies. And I especially love alien/scifi movies. I say the cheaper, cheesier, and campier the better. A low budget and a hokey idea are fun enough for most bad B movies, but this movie is so bad that I really felt embarrassed for the people who made the movie and for the schlocky ad-lib actors. First off, there\&#39;s no real plot, it\&#39;s all sort of situation &#34;comedy&#34; (if it can be called that). The &#34;comedy&#34; in this movie is more about characters saying, in essence, &#34;look at me, I\&#39;m in this crazy situation! Isn\&#39;t this funny?&#34;, but it\&#39;s only pathetic because nothing anyone\&#39;s doing is that funny. There\&#39;s no comedic acting skill, nor any kooky plot to carry all the very un-imaginative scenarios through this dreary turd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad comedy and lack of anything remotely comical is only worsened by the bad ad-lib acting, actors saying really stupid things over and over again (perhaps trying to ape for catch phrases, perhaps just b/c everyone in this is so bad), really unattractive women being played off as hot chicks, and people barfing and passing out in bathrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was one middle aged actor toward the end of the movie who I could tell had some acting chops and was kinda\&#39; convincing in his role. He was as out of place as a solid BM in a weekend detox unit\&#39;s bathroom. Corey Feldman was filmed for about 3 minutes in total (thankfully we didn\&#39;t have to put up with him any longer), and he was filmed off site -- probably outside his apartment on the way out somewhere. He said a few really un-funny things about aliens and having sex with aliens and that was the extent of his appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you value your life and the 90 minutes (and years of pain in remembering) you\&#39;ll lose by watching this garbage, avoid it. If you do a lot of drugs, like Adam Sandler\&#39;s comedy stylings (and thus have no standards whatsoever), and are considered mentally slow you might like this movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I think the people who raved about this must work for Troma or something, b/c I can\&#39;t believe people can be so lame as to actually enjoy this movie. (Do drugs really ruin your judgment that much?)&#39;
b&#39;I know that Trey Parker and Matt Stone really hate celebrities and spoof them in every single episode of South Park (if not showing them, then mentioning them) and they love to mock and joke and make fun of themselves too, but I felt this mockumentary went too far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one thing, the most common running theme in the &#34;documentary&#34; is that they\&#39;re episodes are meaningless pieces of crap they put out just for the money. Obviously, that\&#39;s completely untrue if you even bother to watch any episode, and the constant &#34;You know, I learned something today...&#34;\&#39;s said at the end of almost every episode by the main characters. The creators are also depicted as pompous, arrogant asses who only care about money, including a supposed-to-be-funny-but-isn\&#39;t scene involving Isaac Hayes delivering lines for Chef (over the phone) and Trey Parker yelling and screaming at him for sucking and hanging up. I guess it\&#39;s supposed to be funny, but the pretension in it just really made it... cringe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way they interview employees working for Trey and Matt shows the duo as tyrants who push their employees to the limit, all just for money, in the end. Completely untrue, obviously, and all a joke, but it\&#39;s just not funny. It\&#39;s disturbing, even though it\&#39;s just a joke.&#39;
b&#39;This movie came highly recommended, but I am not sure why. I am not really and Adam Sandler fan though, apart from in 50 First Dates where he departs from his usual angry man routine. Damon Wayans is an undercover cop and Adam Sandler is the guy he pretended to be friends with for a year in order to bust him. Naturally Sandler is rather angry about this betrayal. Cue angry shouting and silly facials from the king of variety. They end up on the run and of course they become friends again after a big misunderstanding (involving Sandler shooting Wayans in the head - he survives thus he is Bulletproof). Need I go on? You will work out what is going to happen if you do watch it anyway. When our DVD player kept pausing (hey it was $80 from the supermarket OK?) it was commented that the player knew the film was boring and was refusing to play it.&#39;
b&#34;I don&#39;t care what anyone else says, this movie is the worst piece of trash committed on film. What was John Landis thinking?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#39;s based on a series of children&#39;s books, but c&#39;mon! Even kids hate this movie. It&#39;s pointless and boring. Tom Arnold once again amply demonstrates that his only talent is wasting production money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the only reason The Stupids hasn&#39;t appeared on the 100 worst films of all time is that only 20 or so people will admit to watching this garbage. At least Hobgoblins made it on MST3K.&#34;
b&#39;After consuming &#34;Human Pork Chop&#34; and properly digesting it, I felt urged and obliged to inform potential viewers, that chewing on this product is NO FUN and its substance of LOW nutritive value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the dull nature of this film, the following is gonna be a WARNING more than a REVIEW. This is the first time I wished, that there is an &#34;I-don\&#39;t-care-to-rate-this-movie&#34;-button on IMDB, because the only reaction to this boring piece of TRASH is stasis and indifference. Every possible rating would do injustice to all the other items listed here, a &#34;10&#34; is out of question anyway, &#34;1&#34; might persuade some readers, that this is one of those cases where &#34;it\&#39;s so bad that it\&#39;s actually REALLY bad and that\&#39;s kewl!&#34;, and &#34;5&#34; is unsatisfying as well, people might think, that it\&#39;s an OK-flick and alright if you wanna have some cheesy fun, which it is not... Honest to God, it\&#39;s neither a &#34;10&#34;, a zero nor a 5, it\&#39;s nothing, a black hole, A FUTILE WORK CONCEIVED BY AN EMBRYO. I bought the region 3 DVD, which was cheap (7 bucks!!!) at least and of good picture-quality, I bought it mainly because of the positive and promising reviews posted below my own entry. Oh boy, was I to be DISAPPOINTED. This movie is neither shocking nor disgusting nor unnerving nor... it\&#39;s not even laughable, it doesn\&#39;t take itself too serious to be laughed at, but still serious enough so as not to be comic. A truly unpassionate, amateurish effort. The only sequence that I found MILDLY DISTURBING is when two giggling thugs put an ugly dog in a bag and bash it against a brick wall... but even such a cruel premise only lead to a poor execution. The further down cited TOILET SCENE is unrealistic and filmmed without any sense for suspense, suffering or humiliation - the feces look like painted marsh-mellows!!! There is a butchery scene at the end of a loooong 85-minutes where three men dressed in plastic raincoats (a setup which one finds also depicted on the front cover of the DVD) start to dispose of the female body. Reminded me of &#34;American Psycho&#34; and &#34;Shallow Grave&#34;, now these flicks are worth watching and true masterpieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let\&#39;s be REALISTIC for once and not rush to make a myth out of every Asian-wannabe-scary-movie, as seems to happen lately...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking out for some eastern horror then try Danny Lee\&#39;s masterpiece of the very same (English) title &#34;Ba Xian fan dian zhi ren rou cha shao bao&#34; (Human Pork Chop) it\&#39;s from 1992 and has - not without reason I might add - been compared to &#34;Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer&#34;. There is also a similar film telling the same story by a different film crew called &#34;Ren tou dou fu shang&#34; (&#34;There Is a Secret in My Soup&#34;) of the same year, sort of a rival production. It\&#39;s available as a region 3 DVD and by most regarded as superior to &#34;Peng shi zhi sang jin tian liang&#34;. I might add a few more words on the special effects... what special effects?!?... there are a few chopped off limbs, they look awful - in a wrong sense - probably &#34;Made in Hong Kong&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That\&#39;s about all the info I can share on this subject, hopefully it will prove helpful... ENJOY YOUR MEAL!&#39;
b&#34;I gotta admit it, I love horror films...especially 80s slasher films. Hell, I even love cheese like Sleepaway Camp and Night of the Demons. But, I didn&#39;t think much of this movie. The death scenes weren&#39;t very well done, the CGI was terrible, and the acting was ho-hum. Worst of all was the story which didn&#39;t make sense at all. I&#39;d say save your money but chances are, if you want to see this movie...you&#39;re going to anyway. I didn&#39;t hate it...it&#39;s just not very good. Overall, it&#39;s just another bland, lifeless horror film that lacks life (it&#39;s no surprise that this one was on the shelf at Dimension for over a year after it was completed).&#34;
b&#39;Awful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the good performance of Ed Harris, Diane Kruger, and the strong budget (the reason for the 3 stars), the movie is by far the worst I saw about a composer, and the worst edition of a masterpiece of music. I agree with some fictional stuff to upgrade a biography, that otherwise couldn\&#39;t be so &#34;charming&#34;. This was done in AMADEUS with best results, but this B copy here is a flaw. Beethoven had a strong personality, but was a sensible artist. Here in this movie however, he looks much more as Mike Tyson! I wonder also, whether despite his deafness, he heard all the whisperings in the last scenes (may be a cochlear implant?). I prefer to listen to the ninth on a CD with some nice maestro. Today most of them conduct modern Wagnerian orchestras. By the way: I gave Amadeus 10/10!&#39;
b&#34;There is a growing trend in the media to vilify and ridicule men. One sees it in television adverts and program plots. Cheaters is a prime example, they could find plenty of female cheaters yet the vast majority shown are men, why? The prime threat to any government&#39;s power resides in the male population, they&#39;re less likely to abide by authority and are more of a physical combat threat. A way to reduce the threat is to emasculate men in society via the media. Other examples of psychological propaganda are crime dramas full of self righteous cops including big-jawed aggressive women accusing everyone they question trampling their rights and making those men feel like scum. In Australia many top male sports stars have been arrested recently for dubious assaults and drinking charges, another example of the government controlling the male populous by arresting their heroes and asserting dominance. Cheaters, aside from the political machinations is an invasion of privacy and a violation of rights, furthermore most of these women assault the men! If it were round the other way the men would be in jail!! If it were an honest show they would be finding women cheaters, because they don&#39;t normally get caught due to the fact that their male lovers are quite happy to get in no strings attached and get out without rocking the boat. Men&#39;s mistresses want the men to themselves and want to own and control the men and thus get the men caught anyway.&#34;
b&#39;One night on an independent channel famous for showing off-the-wall films was aired this monstrosity. Though tempted to turn it off, we watched it to the bitter end, hoping to see some semblance of redeeming value. Alas, there was none. Absolutely nothing. The film quality was cheap; the soundtrack was muddy; the editing was ridiculous. Then again, there was precious little to salvage. After a few minutes of Cameron Mitchell\&#39;s doctor character narrating about some patient of his, the viewer is tortured by no plot, pathetic writing, abysmally terrible acting, and an utter lack of cohesion and continuity. The rotting cherry on top of this fetid mess was the most horrendous &#34;special effects&#34; and &#34;makeup&#34; to ever disgrace the screen, even for television. The main character stumbles through his role in a dimestore rubber mask and a pair of dishwashing gloves which appear to have been dipped in glue and rolled in beads. Perhaps the poor lighting and gag-worthy film quality were attempting to cover up how bad-to-the-tenth-power the makeup was. One can only hope that at least one deliberate decision was made in the course of this hopelessly amateurish video. Seriously, a handful of three-year-old kids could\&#39;ve produced a better project. At the end, poor Mr. Mitchell returns (how desperate he must\&#39;ve been for money!) and drones out some nonsense that\&#39;s supposed to connect this pile of crap with the AIDS epidemic. Please spare you and your loved ones the inhuman cruelty of sitting through this. It was so bad, even Mystery Science Theater 3000 couldn\&#39;t have salvaged it.&#39;
b&#34;Admittedly, you can put a model airplane against a black background and call it sci-fi, and thats enough to get me interested, so if you are like that, Black Horizon will at least get you interested before you watch it. The best part of the movie is when they rehash some actual footage of a shuttle launch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie plays like the Naked Gun series, spoofing cop dramas with bad clich\xc3\xa9s and bad acting. Unfortunately, i don&#39;t think they meant to be funny, the actors really are made of cardboard, the dialog really does suck, so well just have to laugh at them, and not with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, it is rare to see a movie that takes place half in outer space, half on earth, and doesn&#39;t mix in the expected extraterrestrials and supernatural events. I really do ache for more realistic drama based on our space endeavors.&#34;
b&#39;My parents used to rent a lot of horror movies when I was a child. We loved watching them even when they were bad they made for some enjoyment. This was one such movie, kind of hard to review as I have only seen it the one time as a child, but it is not anything I want to track down again so I can do a more in-depth review. The story has some old horror actor legend dying. I seem to remember he acted a bit like an over the top Vincent Price, without being likable and classy. He commits murders and dies, but what is this? Is the movie over already? No, as some kids for some reason snag the body and are prepared for a fun night of being killed by the ham from beyond the grave. I remember the murders were nothing all that special after the first couple and I remember this movie was rather disappointing. Seemed to have a good premise, but it just failed to deliver the goods as more cool kills were needed and that super horror actor needed to add a bit to his repertoire.&#39;
b&#39;I have just wasted my Saturday night watching this crap! I saw the names of Chris Noth (Mr. Big, from &#34;Sex &amp; the City&#34;), Robert Patrick (from &#34;X-Files&#34;), the decadent Elliot Gould, Colm Meaney and Mercedes Ruehl on the credit; a very reasonable IMDb Rating (5,6); and many good reviews in IMDb. For my total surprise, the film is horrible: the characters are badly constructed; the story tries to be funny, but it is totally silly; the character of Mercedes Ruehl is amazingly stupid for a professor of Princeton. So, I decided to investigate the credibility of the good reviews, and I found that most of them are made by IMDb Users with only review, therefore relatives or friends of the cast and crew, or people hired to promote this garbage. My vote is three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title (Brazil): &#34;Sem Retorno&#34; (&#34;Without Return&#34;)&#39;
b&#34;This is just one of those films which cannot justify much of anything that happens. These people are going on a trek: the young girl wants to photograph animals. There really are no Piranhas, but I guess the psychotic hunter guy is the real piranha. Anyway, there are lots of animals and there is lots of driving. There is considerable anti-gun talk, but we all know where that is going. Toward the end, there&#39;s lots of action and a rape thrown in. Somebody must pay, and they do. It would have been nice to have a couple of piranhas to sort of fill the thing out. There were lots of monkeys. If you fast forward through the dull parts, you have a tight little five minutes.&#34;
b&#39;It is sad that Schwarzenegger was the best thing about this production, especially considering the fact that he had not yet come into his own, and was still as stiff as cardboard in his dialog delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, this isn\&#39;t as bad as some critics say, but it isn\&#39;t good, either. It IS amusing, and DOES play like a poor country cousin of the Conan line, making it a conflicted, uneven, poor work. And speaking of poor, the quality is terrible, due to the era in which this was filmed, but that is not the only reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story herein is inferior, even to the Conan line, but moreover, it loses itself in the &#34;Red Sonja must be dominated by big strong Schwarzenegger&#34; ploy, and entirely forgets its purpose, if it ever had one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s entertaining, but in a low-budget, guilty-pleasure &#34;B&#34; kind of way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It rates a 4.2/10 from...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the Fiend :.&#39;
b&#34;I really like Ryan Reynolds and Hope Davis and I actually had high hopes watching this last night on DVD. Mainly as I try to avoid reviews until I watch something myself and form my own opinion Big mistake! My 2 /10 is for the first segment which in fairness is actually quite decent and if they had made the movie about the characters in section 1 alone it may have risen above the 5/10 mark.Once it moved into TV &#39;reality show&#39; territory it stank to high heaven. Ryan Reynolds captured the essence of an actor on the edge wonderfully but as a gay TV writer and famous games creator / devoted family man he was definitely less effective. From the blurb on the box I expected a flashback thriller along the lines of &#39;Memento&#39; - unfortunately this is nowhere near that standard of movie.&#34;
b&#39;I think there\&#39;s a reason this film never came close to hitting theaters. It was probably my neighbors down the street who filmed this movie with their mother\&#39;s video camera. The acting is very amateur. This movie is definitely not something you would want to watch unless you were extremely bored. The actors even seem to double as directors and crew members, with no &#34;professionalism&#34; whatsoever. Should the director(s) and/or actors choose to continue with their endeavor of making movies, I would definitely advise them to brush up on their skills and perhaps take a few (ok, many) classes on film-making and acting.&#39;
b&#39;Primary plot!Primary direction!Poor interpretation.&#39;
b&#34;Milo is a complete rip off of the 1992 slasher flick Mikey, if you actually check it up both films have the same tagline!But if you want to watch an incredibly funny film with absolutely no plot whatsoever......well then this is the film for you.The acting is terrible and the flashback scenes are overwhelmingly confusing. The story behind this atrocity is simple Milo Jeeder is a kid with serious family problems,his father is an abortion doctor who keeps unborn feoutus&#39;s in a jar (NICE!) and was desperate for a child of his own, he figured out a way to bring one of these aborted children to life and he named him............. MILO!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from all the Bad Acting,Terrible directing,annoying sound of Milo&#39;s voice and the ear piercing sound of the bell on his bike ,if you take away all that badness its still a bad but funny attempt at a film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll give it a bank busting 1 out of 10&#34;
b&#34;I like underdogs. So, 12 years after having first seen Star Trek V, and thinking it was bizarrely bad, I gave it a second watch, hoping I would find some redeeming quality which I missed the first time around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The writing is half-baked, and although at first the quality of the acting is stable enough to keep the movie on its feet (albeit shakily), the further we get into the plot the sillier it gets. The last quarter of the film is just plain ridiculous. What was even worse, from the original cast&#39;s POV, is that this was the first ST movie to be released AFTER the franchise returned to television with Next Generation, and the average episode of Next Generation would put this to shame* - including the special effects! What an embarrassment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Final Frontier isn&#39;t thoroughly wretched - I gave it 4 out of 10 - but it&#39;s so far below the standard of its predecessors (yes, including the first one) that the only reason I can think of to watch it is because you&#39;ll appreciate the other movies more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* unless it&#39;s an episode with Troi&#39;s mother in it.&#34;
b&#34;Blond main character, always believes in everyone and when you stick together you can do ANYTHING! Shy guy best friend with curly hair (rip off of Gordo) wants to be a movie director has a secret crush on zoey. Spanish best friend (rip off of Miranda) Weird smart girl Quinn (rip off of Lary Tudgemen)and the popular stock up prep Logan (rip off of kate)And Zoey&#39;s little brother Max, annoying (rip off of Matt)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zoey is the semi popular girl, with 2 best friends. The only thing it&#39;s missing is the funny little sacastic cartoon Lizzie Mcguire has, and Hillary Duff was a lot cuter. Jamie Lynn Spears looks more like a tooth pick in a tube top.&#34;
b&#34;OK, I&#39;m 26 so I&#39;ve been thru all the action heroes 80&#39;s hype, and Chuck Norris along with Seagal, Van Damme and the rest of the guys were my childhood heroes, fighting the bad guys, shooting dozens of bullets from one round only;) I saw the advert of this movie on TV a couple of days ago - Chuck Norris was throwing some fireballs from his fingers. WHOA! &#39;That is a must-see crappy movie!&#39;, I said. And indeed it was. Only a lot lot worse. It is very difficult to see all the movie - stuffed with some religious thoughts, ridiculous zombie-like monsters, who serve Satan, all the idea of a plot set in some forgotten community, which represent whole mankind - it is a load of Christian fundamentalist&#39;s wet dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve nothing against Christianity, even in the movies, but this one lacks taste, it lacks almost everything that connects with a common sense, c&#39;mon, Chuck Norris playing an ANGEL, whose job is to look after little town, where Satan lives?!?! The whole plot is so damn straight and boring, not mentioning its silliness (yes, it&#39;s not stupidity anymore, we&#39;re talking silliness like... like a retarded child&#39;s joke) make altogether terrible movie, made as far as I suppose for elder people very much devoted to Catholic Church, because young viewers laugh at almost every scene. Technically it&#39;s incorrect, the fx are worse than the ones you&#39;ve seen in early 90&#39;s in TV series, the plot seems VERY stupid, actors could be easily exchanged to cardboard stands, not mentioning the music which as far as I&#39;ve heard was played on a childish toy piano. I&#39;ve seen a lot of movies, even the worst ones (the ones from the IMDb bottom list) like &#39;Space Mutiny&#39; or &#39;Manos - hands of fate&#39; BUT believe me nothing compares to this ridiculous, terrible, horribly acted quasi-movie which brings some students&#39; prank movies to my mind rather than regular production. Avoid it. At all cost avoid it. There&#39;s even nothing to laugh at. Chuck Norris has officially finished his movie career.&#34;
b&#39;At the least some of the sitcoms that churn endlessly out of the US are honestly bad. This junk, however, portrays a &#34;heart warming&#34; parenty side to a clothes horse. Acting laughably &#34;learnt&#34; with glances and phrases delivered in the &#34;I\&#39;m SO important and thin and beautiful&#34; fashion. In the episode I just sat agog through, someone\&#39;s &#34;job&#34; was at risk simply because a colleague had &#34;placed&#34; a phone call, slagging her capabilities off ... !! Really, this is the lowest of the low. What kind of damage does this foist on the watching masses, seeing only glitzy glam-puss people parading around &#34;working&#34;. Utterly sick making. When the titles rolled, I thought, oh well, it provided jobs for the boys. You know who you are.&#39;
b&#34;Being an American service member please believe me when I say that this movie in no way accurately portrays the emotional state of our Soldiers/Sailors/Airmen/Marines returning from deployments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is one large steaming pile of clich\xc3\xa9. The acting as awful (with the exception of the little girl) the character&#39;s backgrounds are weak and laughable, and plot is ludicrous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is so bad I made an account with IMDb just to warn anyone with half a brain away from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Canadian writer/director Francesco Lucente should be really, really, really ashamed of this movie. If he disagrees with US foreign policy, he should write a letter to the US government, not punish the entire English speaking world with a monumentally crap film.&#34;
b&#39;This is one of the worst movies I\&#39;ve ever seen. It\&#39;s supposed to be a remake or update of &#34;The One-armed Swordsman&#34;, by Chang Cheh. The ham-fisted direction and crappy fight choreography mean that the fight scenes aren\&#39;t even worth watching. The script tries desperately hard to seem serious, but is full of cliches like, &#34;And I knew then that nothing would ever be the same again...&#34; or &#34;If only I\&#39;d known what a heavy price I would have to pay.&#34; Ugh! And who is that girl who plays Sing? Someone find her and have her eliminated!! She\&#39;s awful. If you like Chinese martial arts movies, you\&#39;d be better off with Lau Gar Leung. This stinks.&#39;
b&#34;ALERT: This review contains major SPOILERS. Do not read on if you plan to see this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judging from the amount of votes this got (my vote was the fifth one) very few people know or care who Mimi Lesseos is. Well, back in the late 1980s, professional wrestling was pretty decent. An all-woman&#39;s federation called the Ladies Professional Wrestling Association opened. It was a great league, and Mimi Lesseos was one of the names on the roster. I always thought she was one of the best people the LPWA had in terms of ring skill and acting ability. Unfortunately, the LPWA closed down in the early 90s, so it only seemed natural for someone with as much talent as Mimi to start an acting career, right? But surely there was an alternative to stuff like this? This movie is really bad. As it was going along, I kept comparing it to an underrated movie called `Survivor Quest,&#39; only this film lacks everything that made `Survivor Quest&#39; enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I started the tape, I went to fast forward through the preview to get to the meat of the tape. At first, I wasn&#39;t paying much attention, but then I realized that the preview was for a movie starring Mimi Lesseos. `Oh,&#39; I thought, `here&#39;s another movie featuring Mimi to look for.&#39; But as the preview dragged on, I became aware that is was a preview for\xc2\x85.&#39;Beyond Fear!&#39; You know you&#39;re in trouble when the only preview at the beginning features the movie you are about to watch! The plot of this thing is pretty standard. Lesseos plays an ex-kickboxer that is living with the guilt of injuring an opponent/friend, so she focuses herself on her second career which she shares with her friend Sammy: being a wilderness guide. On this particular occasion, she gets a troop of three couples. Two of the couples are just there to take up space. You think that one couple, a Caucasian husband and a Korean wife, will be explored, as an issue appears between them halfway through the film, but it is ignored in favor of repeated jokes about bears in the woods, which consistently scares the Korean wife. The joke is funny the first time you hear it, but it certainly isn&#39;t by the ninth time they do it. The third couple is just painful to watch: it consists of Mr. and Mrs. Page. They trade insults back and forth, and Mr. Page uses his video camera for the art of voyeurism when he&#39;s not busy playing cruel jokes on his portly wife\xc2\x85.just like your typical American couple! Before the hike, Mr. Page is spying on two stupid guys and their prostitute. One of them accidentally kills the prostitute and finds out Mr. Page taped it. So begins the peril, as the two guys track the group on their trip, and we wait\xc2\x85.and wait\xc2\x85.and wait\xc2\x85.and wait for them to finally do something. When they do, it&#39;s a fiasco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#39;t blame the cast. They try as hard as they can with the material they have to work with. The main culprit is director Robert F. Lyons, who needs to go back to playing bit parts and stay out of the director&#39;s chair. Lyons starts and stops scenes in such a sloppy, sudden matter that you start to think he was suffering from dyspepsia throughout the entire shoot. There&#39;s even one incompetent moment when a broad daylight scene with the thugs is slipped between some nighttime scenes. Then there is the sound department. The music and background noise completely overpower the dialogue so that you have to move your ear right next to your television&#39;s speaker. Don&#39;t bump your head on the screen! It isn&#39;t worth it to hear the poorly written lines. Speaking of poor writing, Lesseos gets some of the credit there as co-writer. The few interesting developments between characters are often abandoned for shots of the thugs or bad practical jokes. Early on, Lesseos knocks out a thug with a switchblade knife, so not once do you think they are in any danger from the two stupid thugs. When the crooks finally get their rear ends kicked by Lesseos in a well done and long fight, our cast all have a huge laugh together, despite the fact that one of them has been shot and is bleeding everywhere. Yes, everyone is happy in the end. Everyone except the poor souls witnessing the film, wishing for the good old glory days when Mimi performed in the wrestling ring. Zantara&#39;s score: 4 out of 10&#34;

</blockquote>
<p>So far we have been accessing our model endpoint by constructing a predictor object which uses the endpoint and then just using the predictor object to perform inference. What if we wanted to create a web app which accessed our model? The way things are set up currently makes that not possible since in order to access a SageMaker endpoint the app would first have to authenticate with AWS using an IAM role which included access to SageMaker endpoints. However, there is an easier way! We just need to use some additional AWS services.</p>
<p><img src="Web App Diagram.svg"></p>
<p>The diagram above gives an overview of how the various services will work together. On the far right is the model which we trained above and which is deployed using SageMaker. On the far left is our web app that collects a user's movie review, sends it off and expects a positive or negative sentiment in return.</p>
<p>In the middle is where some of the magic happens. We will construct a Lambda function, which you can think of as a straightforward Python function that can be executed whenever a specified event occurs. We will give this function permission to send and recieve data from a SageMaker endpoint.</p>
<p>Lastly, the method we will use to execute the Lambda function is a new endpoint that we will create using API Gateway. This endpoint will be a url that listens for data to be sent to it. Once it gets some data it will pass that data on to the Lambda function and then return whatever the Lambda function returns. Essentially it will act as an interface that lets our web app communicate with the Lambda function.</p>
<h3 id="Setting-up-a-Lambda-function">Setting up a Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Setting-up-a-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h3><p>The first thing we are going to do is set up a Lambda function. This Lambda function will be executed whenever our public API has data sent to it. When it is executed it will receive the data, perform any sort of processing that is required, send the data (the review) to the SageMaker endpoint we've created and then return the result.</p>
<h4 id="Part-A:-Create-an-IAM-Role-for-the-Lambda-function">Part A: Create an IAM Role for the Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Part-A:-Create-an-IAM-Role-for-the-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h4><p>Since we want the Lambda function to call a SageMaker endpoint, we need to make sure that it has permission to do so. To do this, we will construct a role that we can later give the Lambda function.</p>
<p>Using the AWS Console, navigate to the <strong>IAM</strong> page and click on <strong>Roles</strong>. Then, click on <strong>Create role</strong>. Make sure that the <strong>AWS service</strong> is the type of trusted entity selected and choose <strong>Lambda</strong> as the service that will use this role, then click <strong>Next: Permissions</strong>.</p>
<p>In the search box type <code>sagemaker</code> and select the check box next to the <strong>AmazonSageMakerFullAccess</strong> policy. Then, click on <strong>Next: Review</strong>.</p>
<p>Lastly, give this role a name. Make sure you use a name that you will remember later on, for example <code>LambdaSageMakerRole</code>. Then, click on <strong>Create role</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="Part-B:-Create-a-Lambda-function">Part B: Create a Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Part-B:-Create-a-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h4><p>Now it is time to actually create the Lambda function.</p>
<p>Using the AWS Console, navigate to the AWS Lambda page and click on <strong>Create a function</strong>. When you get to the next page, make sure that <strong>Author from scratch</strong> is selected. Now, name your Lambda function, using a name that you will remember later on, for example <code>sentiment_analysis_func</code>. Make sure that the <strong>Python 3.6</strong> runtime is selected and then choose the role that you created in the previous part. Then, click on <strong>Create Function</strong>.</p>
<p>On the next page you will see some information about the Lambda function you've just created. If you scroll down you should see an editor in which you can write the code that will be executed when your Lambda function is triggered. In our example, we will use the code below.</p>

<p>Using AWS Console, navigate to <strong>Amazon API Gateway</strong> and then click on <strong>Get started</strong>.</p>
<p>On the next page, make sure that <strong>New API</strong> is selected and give the new api a name, for example, <code>sentiment_analysis_api</code>. Then, click on <strong>Create API</strong>.</p>
<p>Now we have created an API, however it doesn't currently do anything. What we want it to do is to trigger the Lambda function that we created earlier.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown menu and click <strong>Create Method</strong>. A new blank method will be created, select its dropdown menu and select <strong>POST</strong>, then click on the check mark beside it.</p>
<p>For the integration point, make sure that <strong>Lambda Function</strong> is selected and click on the <strong>Use Lambda Proxy integration</strong>. This option makes sure that the data that is sent to the API is then sent directly to the Lambda function with no processing. It also means that the return value must be a proper response object as it will also not be processed by API Gateway.</p>
<p>Type the name of the Lambda function you created earlier into the <strong>Lambda Function</strong> text entry box and then click on <strong>Save</strong>. Click on <strong>OK</strong> in the pop-up box that then appears, giving permission to API Gateway to invoke the Lambda function you created.</p>
<p>The last step in creating the API Gateway is to select the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown and click on <strong>Deploy API</strong>. You will need to create a new Deployment stage and name it anything you like, for example <code>prod</code>.</p>
<p>You have now successfully set up a public API to access your SageMaker model.
